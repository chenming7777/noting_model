thanks for allowing me time just to give

58
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,950
you a quick update on where we are as a

59
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:13,820
sector for tourism and particularly for

60
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,710
wiper district so a report has obviously

61
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,260
been provided to you and prepared which

62
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:22,400
was our last six months performance at

63
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,900
the end of 31st December 2019 as you

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,250
would have seen Waipa District Council

65
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,740
was going through a significant growth

66
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,320
pretty one of the fastest growing

67
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,790
regions for us with regards to tourism

68
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,560
impact you were experiencing

69
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,480
double-digit growth pretty much down

70
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,450
through visitor expenditure and also

71
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,160
commercial accommodation but we are here

72
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,230
today to discuss this that obviously a

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,150
bit of a change in the dynamic given

74
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:54,010
Kover than the impact for tourism

75
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:54,010
particular sector next slide theme

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,510
perfect so just first a couple of slides

77
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,580
obviously I'm just covering off some

78
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,550
data we're now receiving international

79
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,530
in national data on a weekly basis from

80
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,230
the government and also from the

81
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,240
airlines so of no surprise obviously

82
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,270
since covert lockdown and international

83
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,290
travel restrictions were put in place

84
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,090
international visitor arrivals into New

85
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,730
Zealand has been he'll be dropping it at

86
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,380
a very sharp rate we still do have a

87
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:24,260
line connectivity which I will go

88
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,850
through because we are still maintaining

89
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,330
what we call a baseline service for

90
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,970
Connie

91
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:32,180
across the world mainly for repatriation

92
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,849
flights but also for cargo and service

93
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:41,180
across the country as well mix slides

94
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:43,699
mean things so weekly card transactions

95
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,199
again no surprise obviously overall our

96
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:47,689
visitor expenditure is down

97
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,000
significantly but when you do look onto

98
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:52,250
the left top five obviously food liquor

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,349
and pharmacies we are still seeing some

100
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,680
humor in some obviously weekly growth

101
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:59,690
and expenditure a computer all our other

102
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:09,080
because of the type of expenditure in

103
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:11,870
transactions as well think seem so the

104
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,919
impact for us is a sector again look I

105
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,379
mean everything all of this has been

106
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,719
reported but just to cover off in

107
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:19,279
summary we were already impacted through

108
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:20,930
the loss of China group travel we've

109
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,300
started and the second to last week of

110
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,810
January so with that all of our

111
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:30,139
international facing products our hotels

112
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:32,509
our motels our Airbnb a merely impacted

113
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,190
by that because many are trying to group

114
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:35,930
travel actually did stay on the Y cattle

115
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,449
they were our fourth largest and station

116
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:42,979
or visitor market behind Australia North

117
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:45,050
America in UK Europe it did shut us down

118
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:47,089
pretty much once international travel

119
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,500
restrictions hit us and the visitor

120
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:50,000
economy covers more than just the

121
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,979
tourism operators again with mention

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,889
accommodation it also impacts retail

123
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:56,930
hospitality transport providers our

124
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:59,479
operators of course but also event

125
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,729
organizers in major venues and of course

126
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:04,940
a mystery Creek of anti-drone in Lake

127
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:08,210
hope it'll a key event platforms for

128
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:10,069
wipeout district we have had significant

129
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,699
job losses in business closures across

130
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,990
tourism I have done underneath that last

131
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,000
bullet points look the immediate

132
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,500
business impact that we have been

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,449
coaching our businesses through and

134
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,860
helping them get through there's some

135
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:24,199
have gone to what we call temporary or

136
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,389
seasonal closure so again we have a lot

137
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,490
of seasonality and tourism many who

138
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:29,870
would closed for winter have closed but

139
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,849
those that potentially have never closed

140
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,039
before we've suggested they go into

141
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,270
hibernation and so that's what we're

142
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,490
calling temporary seasonal closures

143
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,930
we've had a number of businesses you

144
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,680
know Hobbiton was obviously one of the

145
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,770
most public

146
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,610
reported in the media but again all our

147
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:48,530
motels hotels retail hospitality have

148
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,760
pretty much reduced service and staff

149
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,040
there's only essential services

150
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,919
operating as we know but again with

151
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,900
elude level 3 we do see some opening up

152
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,660
potentially in the hospitality sector

153
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,240
for white power anyway and then the last

154
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,440
obviously implication for us as we have

155
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,199
here a number of businesses who

156
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,639
appearantly closing not only are these

157
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,990
are lost definitely to the tourism

158
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,990
industry to try and bring people back

159
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,520
when we don't hit products but also

160
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,050
particularly for those vulnerable

161
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,320
communities with some of these operators

162
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:25,550
have been going for many years

163
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:26,990
things seem sure have you got examples

164
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,780
of what businesses are struggling and

165
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,060
like what who isn't closing by who is

166
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:36,650
closing and how it is impacting her in

167
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,780
the water yeah so for wipeouts it was

168
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,979
mainly being your hospitality

169
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,750
potentially some of your retail and also

170
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,099
accommodation so we've had many nearly

171
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,979
all of your accommodation has pretty

172
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:50,479
much gone into hibernation or closure

173
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,860
they're calling it temporary closure but

174
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,380
the some have been able to access the

175
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,580
wage subsidy which is great but again

176
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,099
what we're going to see is the impacts

177
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,320
are longer than the 12-week wage subsidy

178
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:03,080
right now so it's post twelve weeks what

179
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,820
we're quite concerned about we have been

180
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,110
lobbying nationally the government and I

181
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,389
think that's all sectors not just

182
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,580
tourism around potentially extending the

183
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:13,580
wage subsidy for twenty weeks because it

184
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,500
will take a lot to restart the tourism

185
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,990
sector again people's propensity to

186
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,199
travel is quite low we will travel

187
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,280
locally and potentially we will travel

188
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,979
intra regionally so staying within the

189
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,720
region but to try and stand up the

190
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:28,310
domestic travel market is going to be a

191
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,500
long haul they were looking in at six to

192
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,500
twelve months recovery plan for their

193
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,810
great so lastly look I mean and no

194
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,459
surprise here this was just like we do

195
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,349
for industries people know we we all fit

196
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,979
so from the tourism perspective when we

197
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:44,480
respond

198
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,400
obviously we're providing the industry

199
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,270
support right now at a national level

200
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,490
regional level and also a local level

201
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,470
but then we have to Walker at

202
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,930
of Commerce helpers and associations and

203
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,399
all local government have been great and

204
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,320
actually supporting us with what we call

205
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,540
the business and community support site

206
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,070
for tourism businesses and then lastly

207
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,660
we were obviously partnered with the

208
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,120
civil defense network around providing

209
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,130
welfare support not just for tourism

210
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,990
operators again it's also been utilizing

211
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,130
tourism operators many of our caterers

212
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:18,260
have now been repurposed into providing

213
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,550
food services pretty much or supporting

214
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,620
the food banks and actually cooking

215
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,420
meals we also have a number of our

216
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,880
transport operators and tourism being

217
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,010
run basically requisitioned now to

218
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,630
provide transport options and actually

219
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,450
getting people around such as essential

220
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,670
workers in many of the staff potentially

221
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,779
we've been redeploying and to sort of

222
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,839
things need work through providing

223
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:41,360
security and welfare and call center as

224
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,890
well so not only are we also working

225
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,790
with sort of fence were also putting

226
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,790
stuff into beer as well

227
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,839
even though we're obviously dealing with

228
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,700
koba does it does for you to be aware

229
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,430
there are obviously continuing issues

230
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,680
that that were going on with some with

231
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,270
coffered and with the tourism industry

232
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,890
first up was domestic airline

233
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,870
connectivity so lucky and New Zealand

234
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,060
has been pretty open that they will not

235
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,040
be restarting and solute level once we

236
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,300
meet with them you don't weekly just to

237
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,579
see how we will try and stay in the

238
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,990
industry back up again they're going to

239
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:22,940
focus very much what we call an

240
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,130
incremental restart so it's doing a

241
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,020
what's in briefs strategy across the

242
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:30,200
country so potentially maybe only two or

243
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,610
three flights into Hamilton good day but

244
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,040
again is to try and give their reach

245
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,390
across the whole network first before

246
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,010
they can actually stand up and have a

247
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,600
full schedule like we have seen how to

248
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,970
Hamilton import particularly over the

249
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,529
last three to four years airline

250
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,270
connectivity internationally is still

251
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:45,500
continuing so those are just some a

252
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,190
summary of some of the ones that are

253
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,779
still flying

254
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,850
so again New Zealand are still

255
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,550
connecting into North America and Hong

256
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,110
Kong into Australia Fiji Airlines are

257
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,899
still flying into Fiji on the daily

258
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,930
service in Qatar has probably used the

259
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:02,930
most to try and repatriate Northern

260
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,730
Hemisphere travelers back to their homes

261
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,140
through Qatar and then also Korean

262
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,230
Airlines is still operating today

263
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,700
service as well for future again a New

264
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,680
Zealander saying they will be focusing

265
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,810
very much on the domestic market first

266
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,850
they will traditionally be a domestic

267
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,520
airline for the first six to 12 months

268
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,920
and domestic also includes Australia in

269
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,180
the Pacific American Airlines so far

270
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,040
been the only one would meet with who

271
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,890
plane to return to New Zealand from

272
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,050
October 2020 so they have put a stake in

273
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,360
the ground to say when they will start

274
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,890
flying into New Zealand again now the

275
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,620
reason why I was raised international

276
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:39,230
airline connectivity is because it will

277
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,750
take this country at least two to five

278
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,900
years before we ever go back to the type

279
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:47,300
of connectivity with head as a country

280
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,760
previously before lockdown so again it's

281
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,680
going to be a very long burn for us as a

282
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,350
country to regain the international

283
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,760
visitor arrivals have seen in the past

284
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,350
air traffic control services up for

285
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,570
review the reason why I just put Bettany

286
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,760
was just to let everyone know there was

287
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,050
no y cottle reports or or ear fields but

288
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,210
particularly hamilton e port isn't

289
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,160
impacted but for us in the central North

290
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,630
Island Rotorua is one that is going to

291
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,310
be impacted around potentially the

292
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,620
closure of air traffic control tower

293
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,780
services there will mean potentially

294
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,050
that we will be reading the domestic

295
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,490
network through Toronto and Hamilton so

296
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,340
unfortunately for all to do as last it

297
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,660
could be our gain and then lastly we've

298
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,490
still got the investigation underway

299
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,830
around for cardi white island so the

300
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,410
WorkSafe investigation should be coming

301
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,540
to a close shortly there will be impacts

302
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,490
on the tourism in suppliers around

303
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,890
adventure tourism for this country and

304
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,810
also we will be up waiting cual mark

305
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,240
which is their accreditation program

306
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:49,430
particularly around health and safety

307
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:53,120
for the country soon this means that

308
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:55,100
date size we are now filled days is

309
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,410
going online so from the 30th of June

310
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,210
for two weeks field days will be

311
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,430
providing a virtual exhibition space

312
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,780
there is similar to other international

313
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,820
events to offer this type of experience

314
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,910
again it is a trial but we do hope to

315
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,950
bring field days back in 2021 obviously

316
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,720
not only is the largest major event for

317
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,220
y power but it's definitely forward or

318
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,310
why cuddle with regards to eating on a

319
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,870
compact we would do to host New Zealand

320
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,340
tourism awards and November there has

321
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,730
been postponed until niche

322
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,960
we will receive the tape for that

323
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,960
exploring trends these are what we call

324
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,510
our two main international trade shows

325
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,250
they've obviously been delayed trains

326
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:33,080
2021 which is the main time when we

327
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,660
actually sell the work huddle to the

328
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,580
world we will not be having until maybe

329
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,790
June next year so is just awaiting on a

330
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,620
date for that to major convention

331
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,600
centers were due to open this year at T

332
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,550
PI and Christchurch which potentially is

333
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,260
the one there we'll be taking a lot of

334
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,910
business away for our stroll for

335
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,010
business events that has now been

336
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,510
delayed for another year and of course

337
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,180
there musial an International Convention

338
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,620
Center we will not know the reopening

339
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,600
date of there until they work through

340
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,880
there are the final insurance claims so

341
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,950
again by having these two convention

342
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,290
centers not operating means they're

343
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,060
places like cool ones in the mystery

344
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,010
Creek Event Center are going to be

345
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,870
filling the gap for national and

346
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,580
international conferences for the short

347
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,410
term which is actually a good

348
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,440
opportunity for us again as a region

349
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,089
postcode but we also do still have

350
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,190
events plane so the major events

351
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:24,050
obviously the National waka ama is at

352
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,680
this stage still plan to take it a man

353
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,390
to take take a take a feat and like cut

354
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,270
up you know and we also have our first

355
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:34,070
major event for the region the ICC

356
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,560
woman's Cricket World Cup scheduled for

357
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:39,740
the 8th of February again this one will

358
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,300
particularly be decided by around

359
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,190
October November whether we

360
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,380
international travel restrictions have

361
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,170
lifted to enable some of the players to

362
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,540
come otherwise they will have to go into

363
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,650
if it does continue into isolation until

364
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:56,660
the Cricket World Cup can be held so

365
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:58,970
what we have seen goods finically or

366
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:02,060
other parts of the Tito is that events

367
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:04,010
have been more postponed for why par and

368
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,080
for the wider Waikato region rather than

369
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:08,690
completely canceled and not returning so

370
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,400
there is some positivity for us as we do

371
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,220
see this as the lead sector turn to

372
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:24,310
recovery economically and socially for

373
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:27,520
the district it's sliding over spot

374
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:29,890
we have a three tiered response plan

375
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,560
obviously this is no stability everyone

376
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,570
else right now we have a mitigate

377
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,430
process with draconian now we didn't

378
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,890
have a restart phase and then we have a

379
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,140
reimagine phase so initially in the

380
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,660
response phase no different to pronounce

381
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,190
lots of briefings lots of support we

382
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,750
obviously them face to face briefings

383
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,120
across all the sector long before the

384
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,740
shutdown and now we've moved to the

385
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,720
virtual space so we're still doing ever

386
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,130
can see at a national level to try and

387
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,380
make sure you can exit small business

388
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,089
support for the region some of the gap

389
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,620
right now at a government support and

390
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:01,570
out of the support that's what I can

391
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,870
provide as it doesn't cover any

392
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:06,880
employees for a hundred employees plus

393
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,470
so that's quite there's quite the pointy

394
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,690
end of town we call it for most of our

395
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:13,029
region for our big employers again wage

396
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,830
subsidy okay but on the outside of there

397
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:16,180
there's actually no large industry

398
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,890
supports we'll be pushing it through

399
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,410
government let's try and unlock some of

400
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,880
that if this lockdown continues we've

401
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,730
been doing one on one operator chickens

402
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,410
we have 240 listed operators with us and

403
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,240
so again these are daily or to weekly

404
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,530
chickens by all our teams to make sure

405
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,710
you want to be able to access business

406
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,630
advice in some of the wage support we've

407
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,060
been doing webinars and we've now moved

408
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:39,610
in the last two weeks into workforce

409
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,830
redeployment so again we're being taking

410
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,900
some organizations or employers that

411
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:46,510
have maybe at least 5 to 10 staff

412
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,030
members displaced through to Hobbiton

413
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,250
who had one of the largest at around 270

414
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,870
and actually read deploying them and

415
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,330
offering them redeployment options and

416
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,070
to the kiwifruit industry we placed a

417
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,710
hundred and ten staff and to kiwifruit

418
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,480
with transport from hobbiton as well as

419
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,640
the avocado industry which will be the

420
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,079
next seasonal workforce will be will be

421
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,540
standing up until the end of the year

422
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,060
but put stuff into supermarkets sort of

423
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,339
fence security and also they've been

424
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,290
providing some services from home but

425
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:15,579
again what we are going to see over the

426
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,530
next two weeks and we're starting to

427
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,970
measure there is the full-on peaks of

428
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,449
people that we cannot read the point

429
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:24,189
there potentially will be out of work so

430
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:26,949
I think it's currently a survey underway

431
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:28,390
and we'll be updating all councils in

432
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:33,450
the government around the overall impact

433
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:36,640
for tourism is why cuts all things in

434
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:38,100
under the restart phase so again we want

435
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,600
to congratulate local government because

436
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,390
obviously I'm getting some of those

437
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,740
shovel-ready projects through with the

438
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,660
crown infrastructure partners for the

439
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,100
consideration is a great win for the

440
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,410
region but potentially for the sector

441
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,770
and pretty much every district has put

442
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:55,860
up around 1 to 2 tourism projects as

443
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,419
part of shovel-ready so again we do need

444
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,559
to focus on the future and how we will

445
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:03,390
restart the region research we were

446
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,799
already in market and about to finish up

447
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,410
our domestic perceptions and major

448
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,179
research this is now becoming quite

449
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,820
timely for us and will help us and form

450
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,590
around how we will try and bring back

451
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,570
the domestic travelers into the region

452
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:18,330
based on some of the research we've

453
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:20,400
undertaken we're also working on a major

454
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,570
in business events restart campaign so

455
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,549
there planning's been underway for a

456
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,799
couple of weeks so that when we're ready

457
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:27,630
to go we can push go on there we do see

458
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,390
events and business events and corporate

459
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,190
travel as being the Kickstarter we need

460
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,490
for economic and social recovery across

461
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,929
the region new developments again you've

462
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,750
all got new developments going on

463
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,370
potentially in your regions Hidden Lake

464
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,510
obviously one of your newest hotels in

465
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,000
Cambridge and you opened on Christmas

466
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,260
Eve so glean during the team we've been

467
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,640
keeping in touch with quite a lot

468
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,520
because they haven't been in operation

469
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,220
very long the Olympics are quite severe

470
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,870
so again making sure that we still have

471
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,270
some future developments and then we'll

472
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,669
continue across the region and to take

473
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,590
us through the next stage data and

474
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:03,480
insights I've touched on that now gone

475
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,850
to weekly so again we're sharing that

476
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,350
information in to Walker and now we've

477
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,750
contributing to the Taraki can I make

478
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,299
outlook as well which is great and then

479
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,309
lastly the mighty local campaign was

480
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,720
launched two weeks ago and it's

481
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:23,250
definitely around the restart phase

482
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:25,260
things seem so mighty local again was a

483
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,390
partnership with ourselves to Walker all

484
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,010
the chambers of commerce OTR mu-2 and

485
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,990
obviously Cambridge chamber of commerce

486
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,390
plus the way Qatar Chamber of Commerce

487
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,980
all our councils the business

488
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,330
associations it also exists in some

489
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,870
communities and all our regional

490
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,299
eyesight's

491
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,980
we're in phase one so for the last two

492
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:43,799
weeks we've been promoting businesses

493
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,390
with contactless delivery promoting you

494
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,159
know people that are still doing

495
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,380
entertainment online or virtually from

496
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:51,850
within why cuttle recently from our

497
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,800
beloved shifts well-being and for

498
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,390
and this week we launched business

499
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
stories so again we're starting to use

500
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,260
this platform to promote some of the

501
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,570
businesses and how they're pivoting into

502
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,980
obviously response or looking at

503
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,780
different opportunities for their

504
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,240
business so the idea is to try and give

505
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,950
people hope during phase one during

506
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,809
phase 2 which is obviously from a looot

507
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,970
level 3 we will increase your takeaway

508
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,530
and Ethan beam listings and also

509
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:17,380
essential services are starting to grow

510
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,820
as well and phase 2 we will move more to

511
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,950
a local phase at the moment it's a

512
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,200
regional platform but the idea is

513
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,080
potentially people were able to group

514
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,660
the types of information in services

515
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,450
available at a local level and at

516
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,490
district level as well and then phase 3

517
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,570
which has been hopefully all travel

518
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,090
restrictions are lifted

519
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:40,150
we will then activate the basically the

520
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:42,429
the buy local eat local event local shop

521
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:44,140
visit in explore within the region and

522
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:45,400
obviously there's some partnership with

523
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,130
many communities in business

524
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,870
associations they'd already have local

525
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,300
programs such as Cambridge with their

526
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,470
totally locally Cambridge campaign so

527
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,510
we're working with Kelly and the team

528
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,940
around how we would try and push their

529
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:07,570
program rather than this one once we get

530
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:10,330
to phase 3 they seem and when it comes

531
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:12,640
to how we will actually respond long

532
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,110
term so at the moment we're in phase 1

533
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,840
so we're calling it the hyper local

534
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:19,750
phase so 1 to 3 months we'll be pushing

535
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,970
basically localism everything to do with

536
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,490
obviously how you purchase and interact

537
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,900
with your local community at phase 2

538
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,550
which then we'll move into a three to

539
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,080
six month break it we're estimating we

540
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,420
can then start to do ensure regional

541
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,270
travel so we'll be targeting the drive

542
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,070
market within the wirecutter region we

543
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,809
hopefully starting to stand up community

544
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,880
events again they can happen at a local

545
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:41,920
level and regional business meetings

546
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,770
might be able to begin again with social

547
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,750
distancing it level 3 which is what

548
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,580
we're planning our scenarios for 6 to 12

549
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,010
months we can then stand up the domestic

550
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,800
market there is wind potentially we will

551
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:56,740
mainly focus on Drive so if you've heard

552
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:59,679
me say before 2.5 potentially 3 million

553
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,600
people live within three hours radius of

554
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,760
the Waikato region including the region

555
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,440
itself so we'll definitely be focusing

556
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,960
on the drive market

557
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,550
national beans will be returning as well

558
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,070
as national meetings and then eventually

559
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,870
corporate travel which again business

560
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,050
are quite a good lead for us with

561
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,760
regards to the sector again and then

562
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,800
lastly we're planning on one to two

563
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,430
years before we actually start to see

564
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:26,140
any sort of international impact again

565
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:28,960
short-haul markets into Australia in the

566
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,790
Pacific will open first and then we will

567
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,590
eventually move back into major events

568
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,360
international conferences and starting

569
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,330
to bring me the corporate and leisure

570
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,160
travel market into what cuttle so that's

571
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,900
the timeframe we are currently doing our

572
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,540
scenario thinning format is we all know

573
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:52,300
it may change every week based on the

574
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:53,620
other levels we have seen and then

575
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,710
lastly reimagined

576
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,090
so you would have seen that last week or

577
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,830
actually two weeks ago as well the

578
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,050
government announced that there was a

579
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:04,780
call to reshape and reimagine the

580
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,550
tourism industry so we have been pushing

581
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,020
for the last two to three months with

582
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,270
tourism New Zealand and the Minister for

583
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,670
tourism around what we're calling a

584
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,350
reimagining of tourism when we go there

585
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,970
is our chance that this is more than a

586
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,230
shock that's actually a bit of a circuit

587
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,090
breaker for the sector and for all

588
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,800
business sectors for us all to look and

589
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,410
see how could we do our businesses

590
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,900
differently we all knew that tourism was

591
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,190
growing in quite an exponential rate and

592
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,040
there were some areas that were really

593
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:33,130
feeling the pressure such as Queenstown

594
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,570
in Central Otago in Cathedral Cove some

595
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,600
of our sites Mount amadito

596
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,220
so for us now it's great to see the

597
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,390
government are taking this seriously so

598
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,000
we're now working with tourism New

599
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,770
Zealand to lead a new plane domestically

600
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,420
and internationally but also look at all

601
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,920
these types of questions you know we're

602
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,960
our previous visitor arrivals and

603
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,150
spiritual growth right for the region

604
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,610
what mall succeeds to look like for us

605
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,960
for the future for a visitor market here

606
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,700
we movie I'll stick to from boom and

607
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,650
bust again no different to the food and

608
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,050
fibre sector or any other business cycle

609
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:04,030
and lastly how do we move to a more

610
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,010
sustainable community lead tourism and

611
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:08,050
for us and the way cuts are what we call

612
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,640
creating need benefit rather than just

613
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,770
benefiting those that potentially we're

614
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,080
making money out of tourism we want to

615
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,429
see communities thrive and then they

616
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,800
have the decision around what sort of

617
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:18,789
tourism they want so again we will be

618
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,649
moving out

619
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:22,959
sixteen tourism opportunities plane

620
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:24,489
which many of you were involved in we

621
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:26,109
will now be developing a destination

622
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:28,209
management plan and it'll be happening

623
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:30,599
nationally as well to try on what we

624
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:33,609
call transform tourism for the Vita so

625
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:35,499
we there is no such word as recovery now

626
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:38,199
we will not be receiving the same sorts

627
00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:40,119
of level of tourism as we did previously

628
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:41,259
but neither we might not have the same

629
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:43,749
sort of services and opportunities

630
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:46,389
available in tourism as well postcodes

631
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:53,619
so again it is a good opportunity for us

632
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:56,499
to look at transforming the sector look

633
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:58,209
and lastly just obviously a cool I call

634
00:24:56,499 --> 00:25:01,119
it to all my local government partners I

635
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:02,589
really appreciate everyone having to

636
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,839
promote your race relief for missions

637
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:07,079
and installment policies not just for

638
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:09,459
the tourism sector but for all business

639
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,319
it's great to see you all continue with

640
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:14,229
your resource consumed crisis maybe in a

641
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:15,729
more delayed way but again the liquor

642
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:17,859
and food licensing is going to be more

643
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:20,799
important for us particularly try and

644
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:22,509
stand up after a looot level 3 we still

645
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,999
have the regional major event strategy

646
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:27,879
activation so again we are still

647
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:29,829
awaiting some a decision from well

648
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:31,659
energy trust about potentially having to

649
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:33,069
establish a regional major event fund

650
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:35,319
which will actually assist all the

651
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:38,440
districts to be able to bid for major

652
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:40,299
events again and also to attract and bid

653
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,789
new major events into our shoulder

654
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:44,769
season across the region and then lastly

655
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:47,440
again just to thank you all for your

656
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:48,729
continual funding to support the tourism

657
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,129
industry and then it would obviously be

658
00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:53,709
more important through restart in the

659
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:55,869
reimagine phase and again the point I

660
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:57,549
made earlier we will not be recovering

661
00:25:55,869 --> 00:26:01,679
to pre covert levels for at least to

662
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:04,799
five years as a sector and as a region

663
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,179
there's a pretty much it from me I think

664
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,359
so he'll be to take any questions

665
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:13,149
thanks thanks Jason

666
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:14,969
that's I got to say that's a fantastic

667
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:20,469
response to what must have been a

668
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:23,559
massive shock to the industry yeah and

669
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:27,759
of course in white power and probably a

670
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:29,469
lot of Waikato as well it domestic

671
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,070
tourism sexually a lot bigger than

672
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:35,820
international so we really want to see

673
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:38,919
and as you have in your plan that being

674
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:42,220
being worked on as soon as it's sooner

675
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:43,659
that becomes a possibility but yeah does

676
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,480
anyone have questions just put your

677
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:49,269
hands up I can see you all clear

678
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:52,450
okay um yes thanks a lot Jason and yeah

679
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:54,610
fantastic if and I think been put in by

680
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,999
all your team you know in this situation

681
00:26:54,610 --> 00:27:00,100
a couple of questions well the first one

682
00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:02,320
was that I noticed that in the regional

683
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:06,399
major event strategy there's a new

684
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,169
funding partner mentioned is that the

685
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:10,990
well energy relationship or is it

686
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:13,600
alright great useful as well energy yeah

687
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:16,809
no that's great and the other thing is

688
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,850
for your reimagining you know the future

689
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:21,490
of tourism I'd saw that you had your

690
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:24,129
stakeholders listed I didn't see the

691
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:26,110
Department of Conservation being not

692
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:28,330
that they are a tourism operator but

693
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:30,639
most of them you know popular

694
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:33,490
destinations you know I think a

695
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:36,340
cathedral cove you know they're actually

696
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:39,460
managed by the department and and I just

697
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:42,639
want to be worthwhile trying to get them

698
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,769
so around the table so that because I

699
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:46,119
hear you know they worry about the

700
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:48,730
pressure points that we were

701
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:51,700
experiencing and that you know just

702
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:54,399
having their input you know might be

703
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,499
beneficial these they look absolutely so

704
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,570
you're sorry about their clear the

705
00:27:56,499 --> 00:28:00,129
Department of Conservation are part of

706
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,830
it so it's actually a joint tourism New

707
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:04,029
Zealand in doc review of tourism and

708
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,159
it's only because they they both

709
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:09,039
actually contributed to the national

710
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,389
tourism LTL or strategy so they are

711
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,159
definitely part of it we don't obviously

712
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:14,649
have a lot of any national parks but we

713
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,149
do still have a lot of Crown Estate in

714
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:18,070
some of the Crown Estate in our region

715
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:20,590
or obviously so down our waterfalls and

716
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,600
and lake areas so again in and on their

717
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,759
rivers we just they will be engaging in

718
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,320
that as well because we did it obviously

719
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:28,720
have some opportunities with dock

720
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,309
originally before covert so they're

721
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,340
developing shore walls for the region

722
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:34,600
and walks mentals so there's some

723
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,279
projects that we now have brought

724
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,200
forward again to say Campbell dock

725
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:42,720
reconsider moving some of us so mister

726
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,720
marking its unspent history in Wagga

727
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,629
have any other questions this is just a

728
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:54,619
huge thank you Jason to the support you

729
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:56,480
have operators you know I have been I

730
00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:58,609
figured a little myself and that and the

731
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,299
calls that I get from your Tina are very

732
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:03,619
encouraging it's very suiting and just

733
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:05,570
one of the things I just wanted to check

734
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:06,980
in with you on I let some we do have a

735
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,629
presentation a little bit later

736
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,369
among the territory and I see you've

737
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:12,559
also given them some support and that's

738
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:16,429
really great who are reliant on a lot of

739
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:18,139
the international visitors and I guess

740
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:19,489
it's lucky for us in some ways that

741
00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:21,730
there's not that many white power

742
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:24,619
operators at our light on internationals

743
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:26,389
monetary is probably one of them perhaps

744
00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:29,179
our eyesight so to a certain degree in

745
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:30,889
servicing international guests but do

746
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:32,809
you think that there are any other

747
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:34,009
aspects of white power that are going to

748
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:35,239
be greatly affected with them to

749
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:38,899
Nationals because it's really the

750
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:40,850
biggest you know issues going to be it's

751
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:43,119
mainly going to be the sports the sports

752
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,169
coach so I think if we can try and get

753
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,700
some of the international sporting

754
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:48,559
events back up and running as soon as

755
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,450
possible depending on travel

756
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,460
restrictions they would be the main and

757
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,960
paid for wiper but you are correct or

758
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,210
pretty much most of our beans which are

759
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,309
great you know operators pretty much

760
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:00,080
talk to the domestic market and I still

761
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:02,179
feel that again look at the Waikato

762
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,289
expressway the other work they

763
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:05,570
potentially has been put forward for

764
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:07,369
shovel-ready even extremely nice way

765
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,230
down to pier duty there it's just all

766
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:11,269
going to help that ease of domestic

767
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:13,970
travel and we definitely see the push

768
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:15,710
from self-drive obviously the motor home

769
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,480
in Caribbean Association there going to

770
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:19,129
be another first leader and mover back

771
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,049
into the region as well which is

772
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:23,509
fantastic so working with them on a a

773
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:25,730
traveler around trying to get more

774
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:29,779
people back into why pass so I think

775
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:32,090
again your geographic location your

776
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:33,950
natural environment and also your have

777
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,499
been platform so hold you in a stronger

778
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:39,609
position around obviously recovering

779
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:39,609
commute other parts of our region

780
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:45,109
great okay thanks very much for that

781
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:47,119
you've got you've done an awful lot of

782
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:49,879
work and you've got a lot more in front

783
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:52,849
of you I can see but that's great and if

784
00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:54,559
we've got no more queries or we have a

785
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:57,950
recommendation do we ever move it please

786
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:01,990
I think Marcus thinks

800
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,220
thanks for the opportunity

801
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:53,029
welcome to all of the elected members

802
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,070
hopefully we've got a presentation

803
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:59,179
coming up and it should be before you

804
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:02,570
now look today I've also got Scott

805
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:04,730
Kindle my finance manager under one

806
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,700
so Scott will deal with a cup of the

807
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:09,529
finance slides and as most of what we

808
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,080
have to talk to you about is and the

809
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:14,720
realms of finance useful to heaven here

810
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,860
preps not quite the presentation I had

811
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:22,460
intended to present a month ago but as

812
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:25,460
we know a lot has changed and a massive

813
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:28,010
amount has changed for route and the in

814
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,590
the last three or four weeks so the

815
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:32,510
presentation is is primarily and if we

816
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:38,990
can see I move to the next slide is

817
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:42,200
primarily around the covert 19 response

818
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:44,899
for rail but I thought and there's about

819
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:49,039
eight or nine slides to the key slice to

820
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:52,880
take you through and I think what you'll

821
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:56,240
see is how we dealt with the crisis what

822
00:32:52,880 --> 00:33:00,200
the implications have been for the group

823
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,600
now and for the next 15 months and in a

824
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,320
summary that done shed some some

825
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:10,789
positive light at the end of the tunnel

826
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,179
thanks Sam if we move on so I guess the

827
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:14,149
first

828
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:16,999
point I think is useful to you've

829
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:19,429
obviously received our six-month interim

830
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:21,440
results some say you're only as good as

831
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:24,710
your last results but sadly that's not

832
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,749
the not quite the case today but look we

833
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:29,450
were traveling extremely well very very

834
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:31,969
good first six months and in fact on

835
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:35,269
target for a record financial

836
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:38,659
performance under any measure of hourly

837
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:40,759
so I for this this financial year but of

838
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:43,729
course the net led to our draft yes or

839
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:45,830
why that you've also received and then

840
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:48,559
of course is now pretty much irrelevant

841
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:51,109
and I see that you ironically have an

842
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,349
appendix letter to my chair barry harris

843
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:58,669
about um about our why and as you can

844
00:33:54,349 --> 00:34:01,399
imagine we are working very quickly

845
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:05,119
towards a revised is a wife for the next

846
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:06,889
three years particularly the financials

847
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,139
but also there'll be some narrative

848
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:10,339
change and some priority changing as

849
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:13,520
well

850
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:15,799
we have ssa completed a very detailed

851
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,710
fifteen month forecast through the 30

852
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:21,559
June next year that will form of course

853
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:25,010
now part of the year one of the obvious

854
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,809
oh I so look we have a we have a

855
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:30,099
presentation the rail board and myself

856
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:33,730
has a presentation to all shareholding

857
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:39,609
councils in May and we by that stage

858
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:39,609
will have finalized the new drafts so

859
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:51,020
moving alright moving on to the next

860
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:54,819
slide so I think now just looking at the

861
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:57,289
the impact and look very difficult to

862
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:59,420
well it's very easy to explain in simple

863
00:34:57,289 --> 00:35:01,640
terms it's had a massive impact on the

864
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:04,490
business but if I divide it into these

865
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,829
four areas that are before you of course

866
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:10,160
the first result is the aeronautical

867
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:15,140
business in New Zealand complete issue

868
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:18,020
no suspension of flights so for us that

869
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:19,789
was an immediate loss of income really

870
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:23,660
from April but from the last week of

871
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:24,890
March and along with our general

872
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,290
aviation

873
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:29,930
three Harris of flight school basically

874
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:33,950
you know 97 98 percent lost of our

875
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:35,930
aeronautical income overnight terminal

876
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:38,810
plays and we really operating as an

877
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:42,770
emergency medical service only at the

878
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:44,930
airport had the same impact on our on

879
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:47,390
our property but in fact our property is

880
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:50,720
our lifeline that I will come to but

881
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:53,270
again really overnight impact on our

882
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,020
tendencies we're quite large landlord as

883
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:58,610
you know and but to date and Scott will

884
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,370
talk a wee bit about this but to date

885
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:04,670
we've had good support from our tenants

886
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:06,410
but we're early days as we know into the

887
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:08,270
next sort of three to six months as

888
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:11,450
businesses work through how they're

889
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:15,200
going to operate and survive during this

890
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:17,840
process we've obviously suspended the

891
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,940
terminal upgrade work and I'll talk to

892
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,370
that a bit further on which of course

893
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,680
was a major piece of work approximately

894
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:28,940
fifteen million dollars of of proposed

895
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:32,030
work a hotel has been so if we can just

896
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:36,550
go back to the previous slide Sam the

897
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:41,080
hotel impacted significantly as well

898
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:43,900
fortunately during April we have it was

899
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:47,090
taken over by Ministry of Health as a

900
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:50,050
isolation facility it wasn't required it

901
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:53,000
was a backup to the Auckland hotels

902
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:54,770
nonetheless we have received and we are

903
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,560
receiving payment for the use of the

904
00:36:54,770 --> 00:37:00,790
hotel by the government but that ends

905
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:03,470
really this week and from then on

906
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:06,800
difficult times ahead and we'll talk

907
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:08,930
about that and obviously our people and

908
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,810
all my team are working remotely that's

909
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:14,300
working very very well might sort of 11

910
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:17,840
or 12 on our immediate code that team

911
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:22,670
responds but of course the cafe install

912
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:25,280
staff are at home unable to work and

913
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:28,670
part of the government subsidy a risk of

914
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,790
fire team does remain on site at this

915
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:34,160
point so that's really been the impact

916
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:36,350
what have we really tried to do about it

917
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,150
if we could move to the next slide

918
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:41,390
[Music]

919
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:46,070
first of all we we very quickly leading

920
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:48,890
into probably two weeks before we move

921
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:51,680
into level 2 and level 3 or before we

922
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:53,600
even knew what that meant we had worked

923
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,150
very closely with the board around a

924
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,130
pandemic plan how we would operate the

925
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,840
business and more importantly started to

926
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:03,440
look at some scenario and modeling at

927
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:05,480
that point that Jason would have

928
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,370
mentioned earlier on as borders such as

929
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:13,220
China were closing to terrorism we also

930
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:16,730
saw the writing on the ward on the wall

931
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,260
for our own business so that plan was

932
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:21,820
developed and approved by the board

933
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:24,620
before we even went into lockdown we've

934
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,570
completed significant cost reductions

935
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:29,060
and the business that's right across the

936
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:32,290
business of it some major cost

937
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:35,120
reductions in our expense lines

938
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:38,180
reductions pretty much across our

939
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,670
business in terms of payroll anything up

940
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,710
to a 20% reduction and the board have

941
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:45,830
also taken a reduction in their director

942
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:48,940
fees we applied for and received the

943
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:53,300
government wage subsidy across the group

944
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:55,480
and with the hotel we worked through and

945
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,560
are still working through with get Park

946
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,500
but they've gone through a full

947
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,050
restructuring exercise number of people

948
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,120
have been made redundant and number have

949
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,940
been retained under the government

950
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:10,570
subsidy but we have a meeting later this

951
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:13,160
week with chip park to look at stage 2

952
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:15,530
Airport association that we parlor was

953
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:18,770
doing a major piece of work with central

954
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:21,560
government to try and see what support

955
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:23,960
of any there are for airport companies

956
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,240
that have been significantly cut issue

957
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:32,750
no we are we are long term

958
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:35,450
infrastructure owners and to maintain

959
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:39,290
the assets so there's a piece of work

960
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:40,880
going on in that space we already

961
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:47,930
covered the people we can move to the

962
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:51,920
next slide the scenario modeling that I

963
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:54,829
talked about there I think the point

964
00:39:51,920 --> 00:40:00,829
that I will that I'll make here and come

965
00:39:54,829 --> 00:40:02,509
back to at the end is that most airport

966
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:05,809
companies particularly Regional Airport

967
00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:10,190
companies are significantly hurt and hit

968
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:12,619
now we are fortunate that that we made

969
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:15,170
the decision five or six years ago that

970
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:16,819
the board then under under the

971
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:20,329
leadership of John Spencer and then

972
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:23,239
implemented by myself and my team we've

973
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:27,140
we have as you know diversify the

974
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:30,470
airport company and that is I guess

975
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:34,130
bought us time so we have completed a

976
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:36,789
very conservative model for argument's

977
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:40,579
sake that assumes no in New Zealand

978
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:44,989
activity of any of any meaningful sense

979
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:47,869
before October this year no and then

980
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:52,160
only a recovery of about 40 percent of

981
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:56,779
passenger numbers through 2021 calendar

982
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,930
year and well into 2022 before we have a

983
00:40:56,779 --> 00:41:02,059
positive EBIT da really so what is and

984
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:08,390
we've also taken a very conservative

985
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:11,720
view of leases of early season ability

986
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:14,119
to pay us etc no activity out of the

987
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,890
hotel really for the balance of this

988
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,130
Condor year

989
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:22,130
I so very very conservative but

990
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:24,380
realistic modeling fortunately we have a

991
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:29,680
major land sale that is unconditional

992
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:32,119
and very extremely good family

993
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,749
significant family multinational

994
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:37,430
business that have agreed to further

995
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:39,380
provide a letter of credit to the

996
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:42,319
airport company which gives me

997
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:46,309
confidence to to build the road so to

998
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:49,849
speak so that delivers about two and a

999
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:52,660
half million dollars of margin of free

1000
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:55,940
cash flow into the group early next year

1001
00:41:52,660 --> 00:42:00,160
so the reality is that we can get

1002
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:03,410
through this year and through to June 21

1003
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,600
almost a slightly positive cash position

1004
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:08,110
the balance sheets taking a bit of a her

1005
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:11,090
and Scott will take you through that but

1006
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:13,280
and also we have some work going on on

1007
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:15,470
Central Precinct and again we have the

1008
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,660
ability hopefully to settle some

1009
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:19,940
unconditional land sales with the same

1010
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,550
degree of confidence around fear the

1011
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:25,730
sureties which will also feed some

1012
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:29,120
additional cash into the group we've

1013
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:32,210
only utilized about 65% of our of our

1014
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,340
debt funding and in fact we have fear

1015
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:37,490
the facilities that we were intending to

1016
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,500
take anyway pre covert and we will still

1017
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:43,460
take which will take our funding up to

1018
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:46,280
about 30 million and then we will have

1019
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,140
only utilized not much more than 50% of

1020
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:52,790
that by June next year

1021
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:56,180
so most most of the cash burn is funded

1022
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:59,120
out of out of our overdraft during this

1023
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:02,750
period and then the land sales kept

1024
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:07,370
beckon and we're back and positive space

1025
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:11,360
being said very supportive and no no

1026
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:13,600
issues there around funding next slide

1027
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:17,710
please

1028
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:22,070
so we had joined with Hamilton City and

1029
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:24,410
and I had spoken to Gary diet and others

1030
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:26,900
around the obviously the crown

1031
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:29,030
infrastructure projects we have put

1032
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:34,010
forward to applications if you've had a

1033
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:36,050
chance to to review the submission she

1034
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:38,450
might would be aware there are 23

1035
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:42,260
projects we have submitted for the

1036
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:44,840
terminal redevelopment and also for an

1037
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,300
amalgam of a number of projects around

1038
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,940
the airport that deal with roading

1039
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:56,480
lateral infrastructure our wastewater

1040
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:59,180
plant and various other s speak again is

1041
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,410
also worth about 11 million dollars so

1042
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:05,660
we have put person whether we're

1043
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:07,490
successful who knows but under the

1044
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,250
terminal redevelopment project we're

1045
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:12,440
ready to go tenders have been received

1046
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:15,950
and Emirate being evaluated the week of

1047
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,530
lockdown our consent is in with one with

1048
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,099
your council at the moment and that's

1049
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,229
well there was

1050
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:23,839
well underway so it is a shovel-ready

1051
00:44:21,229 --> 00:44:26,420
project we could be out of the ground

1052
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:31,430
and doing a neighboring works within a

1053
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:33,710
month of a funding line the key for

1054
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:36,859
myself and the board will be what are

1055
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:39,680
the tags that the government apply if we

1056
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:43,819
are successful to the funding mechanism

1057
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:48,589
how much of it is the loan as a grant

1058
00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:50,809
etc that's underway a next part of our

1059
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:59,359
recovery program so if we go to the next

1060
00:44:50,809 --> 00:45:01,940
slide being important as we work through

1061
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:03,799
really the devastation of the past three

1062
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:07,220
or four weeks to make sure that we still

1063
00:45:03,799 --> 00:45:10,039
keep our eye on the longer term for the

1064
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:12,950
group in our our focus over the next 12

1065
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:15,170
months I once been any detailed time

1066
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:19,279
here other than to let you know that we

1067
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:23,469
have a clear set of clear business plan

1068
00:45:19,279 --> 00:45:26,599
and a clear set of objectives for FY 21

1069
00:45:23,469 --> 00:45:28,400
most of those remain in place we are

1070
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:32,259
reviewing them currently as a management

1071
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:35,890
team but we are trying to make sure that

1072
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:38,239
we continue property as a major

1073
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:40,549
contributor even as you can see there

1074
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,829
potentially to shy of eight million

1075
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:45,640
dollars in land sales in this next

1076
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:49,069
12-month period

1077
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:52,009
operations we continue to maintain the

1078
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:55,369
runway fortunately in our ten-year asset

1079
00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:57,559
management plan we have a very quiet we

1080
00:45:55,369 --> 00:46:01,069
just spent close to a million dollars

1081
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:04,460
finishing in March of this year on some

1082
00:46:01,069 --> 00:46:06,979
apron works and some pumps some other

1083
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,739
bits and pieces but we have a very quiet

1084
00:46:06,979 --> 00:46:12,440
couple expenditure for nautical over the

1085
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:13,430
next 12 to 18 months which couldn't have

1086
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,979
come at a better time

1087
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:20,900
but we maintain the assets and you need

1088
00:46:15,979 --> 00:46:23,749
to know that we that we will when it

1089
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:25,339
comes to we'll be working very closely

1090
00:46:23,749 --> 00:46:29,630
with the New Zealand to try and

1091
00:46:25,339 --> 00:46:33,020
obviously kickstart services again and

1092
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:35,450
so our whole marketing and

1093
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:39,349
social media and common strategy will be

1094
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:42,770
around exactly that the hotel is a much

1095
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:47,210
more difficult beast as you would have

1096
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:51,290
gained from Jason's presentation but

1097
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:54,470
look we we are working now closely with

1098
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:57,470
jetpack to understand what a weather

1099
00:46:54,470 --> 00:47:00,530
plane coming out the other side may look

1100
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:02,630
like fortunately it's a hotel

1101
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:04,960
that wasn't reliant on international

1102
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:09,470
tourism but it is relaxed on

1103
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,869
conferencing in particular and we get to

1104
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:14,270
understand the behavior of the business

1105
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:18,290
community as we go forward in this new

1106
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:20,359
world so we have just almost spending

1107
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:26,390
most of four million on the hotel just

1108
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:29,150
prior to lockdown so it is a it's a it's

1109
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:32,630
a property that we're going to have to

1110
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:37,040
maintain in the meantime in fund and our

1111
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:40,010
conservative modeling does does mean

1112
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:43,040
that the group can fund its interests in

1113
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:48,140
the hotel Sydney for the next 18 months

1114
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:50,089
with limited activity from it and if we

1115
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,940
move now into the next slide which is

1116
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:55,760
probably the financial certain couple of

1117
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:58,730
slides here on on sort of financials and

1118
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,099
and all its got leader now our

1119
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:04,000
overarching comment here would be you

1120
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:06,710
had a lot of detail in the six-month

1121
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,960
interim results so we decided there was

1122
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:11,390
no point in replicating information you

1123
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,490
will have read so Scott will summarize

1124
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:17,540
it here and more importantly take you

1125
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:18,800
out the other side of years Brad good

1126
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:21,140
afternoon everyone and thanks max

1127
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,490
introduction um yeah I won't dwell too

1128
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,440
much on the past because it's

1129
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:26,330
unfortunately you become largely

1130
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,220
irrelevant but I guess just some key

1131
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:30,320
takeaways to the slide and what you may

1132
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:32,510
have read already an interim report but

1133
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,820
really that momentum we built in the

1134
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:36,920
past couple of years around a

1135
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,359
sustainable so recurring revenue basis

1136
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,190
through passenger growth in the airport

1137
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:41,990
business I'm sure a property portfolio

1138
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:44,780
that it continued really well for the

1139
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:46,660
first half of the year and you know

1140
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:48,220
obviously without cover the ninth

1141
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:51,220
we expected to continue through the full

1142
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:52,810
year and beyond yeah it's just the

1143
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,780
points are properly obviously talking

1144
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:57,580
some big numbers really in sales I guess

1145
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:59,830
that they are laying cells that have

1146
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:01,570
been contemplated under a 10-year plan

1147
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:03,550
the lens doesn't quite line it's not

1148
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:06,430
something that we've done as a knee-jerk

1149
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:07,960
reaction all sort of a fire sale type

1150
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:08,590
arrangement just to get some cash next

1151
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,200
couple years

1152
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:13,270
these are on the land with selling as

1153
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,040
sort of surplus to your Oracle

1154
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:16,660
requirements affect much of it's

1155
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,040
actually physically separated from the

1156
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,140
airport through a gallery system so

1157
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:23,560
we're not compromising any core asset

1158
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:27,070
sort of future capability by selling

1159
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,840
this land very much as lender service

1160
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:32,740
the airport's that's why it's being sold

1161
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:34,660
off time it has been yes just with the

1162
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,570
hotel you see it as a new investment for

1163
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:38,620
us a new industry would be Siddhant

1164
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:41,680
really pleased with the early trading

1165
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,120
performance yeah and probably pleasing

1166
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,390
that we didn't other than the initial

1167
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:48,160
money to do the property app tenders and

1168
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:50,410
deferred maintenance and things it's

1169
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,210
actually traded catch so positive he has

1170
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:55,450
much been profitable with depreciation

1171
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:57,880
and things but really able to repay some

1172
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,650
debt and you know the early vital signs

1173
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,760
were an occupancy in rem rate have been

1174
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:03,340
have been certainly in line with

1175
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,170
expectation and again kind of right up

1176
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,430
until February March it was really just

1177
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:08,470
coming into its stride around the

1178
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:11,080
conference center and the food and

1179
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:14,110
beverage offerings so yeah I think you

1180
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:16,180
know it was you know was looking really

1181
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:18,550
positive and hopefully don't the other

1182
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:21,300
side that's the O momentum we can and we

1183
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:23,560
can leverage off again so probably look

1184
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:26,340
look to the future now just move to the

1185
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:29,350
next slide please

1186
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:31,600
yes I've given here just sort of an

1187
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,560
six-month increments the remainder of

1188
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,960
the financial year

1189
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,220
I'm also fighting sure that we're in and

1190
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,660
then the following three that are

1191
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:40,630
presented and the drafts then in a

1192
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:42,250
material received I think important to

1193
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,780
focus on a bit there because it's sort

1194
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:46,480
of a cash flow

1195
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:48,190
metric for us that includes then sales

1196
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,010
but it excludes of course costs like

1197
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:52,870
depreciation which because around three

1198
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:55,290
million dollars here for us which in the

1199
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:57,820
short term there's not necessarily

1200
00:50:55,290 --> 00:51:00,589
linear worth they with the investment we

1201
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:03,410
make into assets so seeing

1202
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:05,959
I'll see seeing a reasonably significant

1203
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:08,449
decline in the next and this calendar

1204
00:51:05,959 --> 00:51:12,439
year with across the business certainly

1205
00:51:08,449 --> 00:51:13,640
gonna suffer omits as we see in that's

1206
00:51:12,439 --> 00:51:15,140
sort of early six months between

1207
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,479
December twenty and Jo next year that's

1208
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:20,390
the effect of this largely and so I'm

1209
00:51:17,479 --> 00:51:23,059
taking your feet I mean as the business

1210
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:25,069
kinda gets back on its feet you can see

1211
00:51:23,059 --> 00:51:27,019
it's slowly back to cashflow positive so

1212
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:28,640
I guess you want to compare the read the

1213
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:30,109
read in the blue the blue bars and red

1214
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,150
line and the Green Line is subtly we

1215
00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:34,279
think we can ahead now you can see

1216
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:35,479
you're definitely next to the fifteen to

1217
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:39,229
eighteen months it's gonna be a bit

1218
00:51:35,479 --> 00:51:40,699
painful but after they're pretty much

1219
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:43,039
back on their feet they're not becoming

1220
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:44,630
heavily reliant on our land sales

1221
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,789
certainly a person takes 18 months

1222
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:48,680
so we've only seen what's already under

1223
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:51,349
contract and wants unconditional ctul

1224
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,880
and those numbers so I think that's the

1225
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:55,239
conservative but realist looking and

1226
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,829
conservative conservative on both fronts

1227
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:58,969
I'm sitting at it costs we're looking to

1228
00:51:57,829 --> 00:52:00,650
Road out of the business on anything

1229
00:51:58,969 --> 00:52:03,339
that's gonna compromise this long term

1230
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:05,449
we're not giving out capability but

1231
00:52:03,339 --> 00:52:07,400
either we've built or with managed to

1232
00:52:05,449 --> 00:52:09,949
hang on to for as long as we have but

1233
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,719
it's um yeah definitely conservative and

1234
00:52:09,949 --> 00:52:13,880
look if things don't play out the way

1235
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:15,949
and we see them doing and certainly not

1236
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,989
as positive as they might do there's

1237
00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:20,779
some opportunities if they're that but

1238
00:52:17,989 --> 00:52:21,979
for now it's this sort of as realistic

1239
00:52:20,779 --> 00:52:25,339
that we can preserve a current

1240
00:52:21,979 --> 00:52:27,949
capability anyway yeah I guess just

1241
00:52:25,339 --> 00:52:30,799
overlaid a neat profit slide yeah

1242
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:32,719
there's a lot more probably the deficits

1243
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:35,420
are bigger largely because of the effect

1244
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:37,429
of depreciation but ultimately following

1245
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,640
a really similar tree into the cash flow

1246
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:42,589
that layer in sales over the next 18

1247
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,199
months will give us cash flow positive

1248
00:52:42,589 --> 00:52:47,299
and we expect by the end of bustles to

1249
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:50,329
be largely cashflow positive from it's

1250
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:53,929
recurring trading to be sustainable and

1251
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:56,420
yeah that's probably I guess the main

1252
00:52:53,929 --> 00:52:59,089
takeaway there and it's not really built

1253
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:01,039
into the slides but just as much on the

1254
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:02,779
balance sheet like we speak there will

1255
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:04,969
be some impacts to our balance sheet

1256
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:07,189
around property values and those sort of

1257
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:09,289
equity movements so as a shareholder

1258
00:53:07,189 --> 00:53:12,259
that obviously will impact your accounts

1259
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:13,860
as well but I guess out of this as a

1260
00:53:12,259 --> 00:53:16,500
shareholder and an on fire

1261
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:18,630
or sense out of all of us we're

1262
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,130
preserving our core capability and we're

1263
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:23,520
not compromising any of it in nautical

1264
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:25,590
capability I think yet in terms of what

1265
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,300
the service will keep delivering that

1266
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:30,030
shouldn't be compromised or at least our

1267
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:32,580
ability to do it that was really all I

1268
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:35,340
had just view the financials somewhat

1269
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:36,270
beep aspect to wrap up this is their

1270
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,940
last slide

1271
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:41,040
my apologies that's it we've taken a bit

1272
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:46,280
of your time but look I think the key

1273
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:49,470
themes here really are as I opened up we

1274
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:54,120
hit this situation in a very strong

1275
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:58,710
position and in a very strong balance

1276
00:53:54,120 --> 00:54:00,780
sheet a record year the fourth side of

1277
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:03,830
the diversification through our ten-year

1278
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:08,250
group strategy has I think really bought

1279
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:10,170
this company time Pretz unlike some

1280
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,940
other regional airports that I think

1281
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:15,780
will need to go to their shareholders

1282
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,640
very quickly for additional funding or

1283
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:22,890
through their through their bank funding

1284
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:26,460
lines we don't need to that non revenue

1285
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:29,040
has been absolutely critical to - and in

1286
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:33,960
fact ironically we never predicted a

1287
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:38,390
covert 19 scenario but we did predict a

1288
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:41,250
loss of aeronautical income through

1289
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:46,880
cessation of services or reduce services

1290
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:51,390
so has been one on the same and look

1291
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:54,890
overall the recovery is Scott as

1292
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:59,700
mentioned will be modest but sustainable

1293
00:54:54,890 --> 00:55:01,800
and as I want to keep restating we won't

1294
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:06,300
need to go to our core deep at this

1295
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:09,810
stage or funding lines to fund this we

1296
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:14,010
can fund it out of an effective working

1297
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:16,020
capital and most importantly I think for

1298
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,540
you as this year holders there is no

1299
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,610
requirement for the board to come to its

1300
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:25,260
shareholders for support and we don't

1301
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:27,750
see a scenario at all that that requires

1302
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:30,110
the shareholders to assist the

1303
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:33,360
your company in the foreseeable future

1304
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:36,750
so that's it from me sorry and drug

1305
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:38,330
apologize if we're over time but happy

1306
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:42,390
to take questions if you've got time

1307
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:45,150
yeah no thanks guys I think we were

1308
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:47,700
aware that a bit of extra time was going

1309
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:50,610
to be required for you guys with such a

1310
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:52,560
massive impact and I just got a quick

1311
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:55,560
question about the flight school and

1312
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:57,480
when would they not get back to level

1313
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:00,390
one or possibly could they operate and

1314
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,790
level two when in fact scoffs just hit

1315
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:04,800
some advice today it could well be that

1316
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:06,810
the pilots that are that are will

1317
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,390
through their qualification will be able

1318
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:11,520
to start flying under level three so as

1319
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:14,640
soon as next week we could see some

1320
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:17,340
flight activity but it will be to your

1321
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,590
point Andrew down at level one probably

1322
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:22,170
but there'll be the social distancing

1323
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:24,570
issues when you have an instructor and a

1324
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:27,870
trainee pilot on board so I think where

1325
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:30,420
we still are unclear and so are all

1326
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:34,980
three as to when that will be

1327
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:36,660
I think it's worth noting that we don't

1328
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,340
quite know where we're going to go with

1329
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,900
all three in the sense that they've got

1330
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:43,230
a hundred one hundred and eighty pilots

1331
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:47,850
currently at the airport and in Hamilton

1332
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:51,030
or out at the accommodation at the

1333
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:52,290
airport so I think we will fight there

1334
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:54,570
fine for the next few months the

1335
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:56,550
question is how whether they're going to

1336
00:56:54,570 --> 00:57:00,500
beat the logistics of moving pilots

1337
00:56:56,550 --> 00:57:03,660
across borders for training and actually

1338
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:06,570
pilots there is not a dearth of pilots

1339
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:08,460
in the global marketplace as a result of

1340
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:09,150
the catastrophe catastrophe for the

1341
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,930
airlines

1342
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:15,540
so I think those two would suggest to us

1343
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:20,640
that we've got difficult times ahead

1344
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:22,520
place the end of 2020 with l3 yeah that

1345
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:27,230
makes sense

1346
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:31,190
yeah I think it's as you've both noted

1347
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:34,320
the stage that you're at with your

1348
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:37,710
property development has been a very

1349
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:39,150
fortunate thing if this had occurred at

1350
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:42,200
the beginning of that it would have been

1351
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:46,480
far more um if I naturally just

1352
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,480
but does anyone else have any queries

1353
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,650
okay that not be in casework thank you

1354
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:56,690
very much a really comprehensive update

1355
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:59,690
and great to see you recovered from the

1356
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:02,900
shock and being really positive and

1357
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:07,420
constructive going forward so thanks

1358
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:16,250
very much to you both thank you ma'am

1359
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:18,590
yes and I see we have Melvin sorry what

1360
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:21,550
was that ah

1361
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:24,980
okay so we got Kelvin and also as Peter

1362
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:29,650
available yes I am oh great

1363
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:34,940
so thanks Kelvin and Peter um and we'll

1364
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:36,650
get on to the services thanks mr.

1365
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:39,170
chairman and thanks for the opportunity

1366
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:40,930
to speak with you this afternoon you've

1367
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:44,120
been provided with a copy of the

1368
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:47,240
company's statement of intent and half

1369
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:49,100
yearly report to 31 December 2019 and I

1370
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:52,420
I'm conscious of the fact this is the

1371
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:56,150
first opportunity I've had is the newish

1372
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:58,280
chair of the LES to talk to you so I

1373
00:58:56,150 --> 00:59:00,590
wanted to start by just briefly

1374
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,510
introducing myself and then I wanted to

1375
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:05,330
talk a little bit about the company's

1376
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:07,280
transformation role how are we going to

1377
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:09,230
do things differently what it means for

1378
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:12,380
your counsel and then I want to conclude

1379
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:15,230
with some remarks about covert 19 but I

1380
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:17,210
guess the key point is that certainly

1381
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:19,700
from the board of lessers perspective

1382
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:22,960
the organization has never been more

1383
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:27,410
relevant than it will be in a post

1384
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:30,470
covert 19 recovery period so the first

1385
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:32,120
point I wanted to make is that my family

1386
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:35,270
has been heavily invested in the white

1387
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:38,810
cutoff for a very long time my mother's

1388
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:40,550
family came to this region in 1865 my

1389
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:42,830
father's family came to this region in

1390
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:45,590
1880s and all my family live in the

1391
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:47,780
region my mum lives and kuroky district

1392
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:49,790
my sister lives and Tim's coromandel I

1393
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:54,140
have another system in Hamilton a

1394
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:55,279
brother and Waipa District and after 44

1395
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:58,579
years and

1396
00:59:55,279 --> 01:00:01,880
leaving Auckland next week and moving to

1397
00:59:58,579 --> 01:00:04,039
Cambridge so we very much look forward

1398
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:08,539
to becoming our district council

1399
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:10,609
ratepayers from the 1st of May so as you

1400
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:12,650
can see my family's been heavily

1401
01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:14,089
invested in the success of the region

1402
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:16,549
and it's one of the reasons I took the

1403
01:00:14,089 --> 01:00:18,890
job but the other reason is the clarity

1404
01:00:16,549 --> 01:00:20,689
of the opportunity and I've spent 21

1405
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:24,109
years in local government governance

1406
01:00:20,689 --> 01:00:27,109
across multiple CCOs and and clarity of

1407
01:00:24,109 --> 01:00:29,150
role is actually quite unusual in this

1408
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:31,489
case that company's vision is to have

1409
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:33,890
Waikato Council's working together in

1410
01:00:31,489 --> 01:00:35,569
the best way possible for the collective

1411
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:38,059
benefit of them and their communities

1412
01:00:35,569 --> 01:00:40,759
which means less burden on ratepayers

1413
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:44,479
happier communities council staff and

1414
01:00:40,759 --> 01:00:46,609
more effective councils so every as

1415
01:00:44,479 --> 01:00:49,039
we've set out in our statement of intent

1416
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:51,699
the organization really exists to do

1417
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:54,549
three things first of all to create

1418
01:00:51,699 --> 01:00:57,469
effectiveness and efficiency games for

1419
01:00:54,549 --> 01:00:59,089
shareholders such as you secondly to

1420
01:00:57,469 --> 01:01:02,150
help increase the influence of the

1421
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:05,289
region and thirdly to help shareholders

1422
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:08,599
provide a better customer experience

1423
01:01:05,289 --> 01:01:11,779
what les does is provide an opportunity

1424
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:14,919
to think regionally without boundaries

1425
01:01:11,779 --> 01:01:17,959
and to then help councils use that

1426
01:01:14,919 --> 01:01:18,469
locally to improve the well-being of the

1427
01:01:17,959 --> 01:01:21,229
community

1428
01:01:18,469 --> 01:01:23,419
so thinking regionally means that rather

1429
01:01:21,229 --> 01:01:26,209
than individual councils trying to solve

1430
01:01:23,419 --> 01:01:28,400
their problems individually les can help

1431
01:01:26,209 --> 01:01:30,769
them work them out with the costs of

1432
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,419
that spread while still allowing local

1433
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:36,949
choices to whether to implement

1434
01:01:32,419 --> 01:01:38,900
solutions locally I think that if sphere

1435
01:01:36,949 --> 01:01:40,159
to say my observation would be that over

1436
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,229
the years of its existence the

1437
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:44,209
organization has done a good job but I

1438
01:01:42,229 --> 01:01:45,709
think one of the reasons that I've been

1439
01:01:44,209 --> 01:01:48,979
hired is that there was an opportunity

1440
01:01:45,709 --> 01:01:52,400
seen to be able to really grasp the

1441
01:01:48,979 --> 01:01:53,989
company's potential so when I was high

1442
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,150
the board said that it wanted to

1443
01:01:53,989 --> 01:01:59,390
undertake a number of transformative

1444
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:01,939
projects at Pace and for that reason we

1445
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:05,419
are going to end our driving the

1446
01:02:01,939 --> 01:02:07,429
organisation harder and faster and

1447
01:02:05,419 --> 01:02:08,150
earlier this year the board committed to

1448
01:02:07,429 --> 01:02:10,789
do

1449
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:14,029
just that we are looking to be bolder

1450
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:17,270
more disruptive to enable you to help

1451
01:02:14,029 --> 01:02:20,720
you transform how you and other work at

1452
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:23,920
all councils operate we also won't be

1453
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:25,849
afraid of failing and by that I mean

1454
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,029
recognizing that opportunity's worth

1455
01:02:25,849 --> 01:02:31,010
pursuing as long as we do it fast

1456
01:02:29,029 --> 01:02:33,109
coming from the private sector having

1457
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:35,150
spent 35 years in the private sector my

1458
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:36,529
observation would be that there's

1459
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:40,549
nothing wrong with failure so long as

1460
01:02:36,529 --> 01:02:42,799
you fail fast and fail cheap so within

1461
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:44,029
that in mind and looking ahead over the

1462
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:46,220
next 18 months

1463
01:02:44,029 --> 01:02:48,349
there are really three core elements to

1464
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:50,210
what we're doing there are some key

1465
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:51,829
strategic projects which will be looking

1466
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:53,329
to advance as fast as possible and

1467
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:56,150
you'll see those projects in the

1468
01:02:53,329 --> 01:02:58,670
statement of intent there are some

1469
01:02:56,150 --> 01:03:02,150
businesses usual projects and in

1470
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:03,559
addition I've asked for a reexamination

1471
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:06,970
of some of the work that we're doing to

1472
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:06,970
see whether we should stop doing it

1473
01:03:07,069 --> 01:03:12,529
as you'll appreciate it it's really

1474
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:13,910
fundamental to perceptions of success of

1475
01:03:12,529 --> 01:03:16,309
an organization that they seem to be

1476
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:18,529
making progress month by month so one of

1477
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:20,779
the things we've done is introduced a

1478
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:22,369
lot more careful tracking about what it

1479
01:03:20,779 --> 01:03:24,140
is that we're doing and whether we're

1480
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:25,910
being successful and we're looking to

1481
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:30,079
improve the communications to key

1482
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:31,730
council staff as well I've said to my

1483
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,799
board colleagues and you'll be aware I'm

1484
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:35,720
sure that the that everyone that sits

1485
01:03:33,799 --> 01:03:38,630
around the last board with the exception

1486
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:41,720
of me as a chief executive of one of

1487
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:43,010
them in the council's I've said to my

1488
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,599
board colleagues that they are really

1489
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:46,910
the difference between less succeeding

1490
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:48,289
and failing that and the reason for that

1491
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,520
is that they are the ones who will

1492
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:51,829
dictate the resourcing and

1493
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:54,799
prioritization and cooperation which is

1494
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:56,930
accorded to less projects and obey the

1495
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:58,460
point pretty clearly that without their

1496
01:03:56,930 --> 01:04:01,760
total commitment the organization will

1497
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:03,799
fail but equally their success lesser

1498
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:07,670
success will be their success and vice

1499
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:11,690
versa so turning now to what it means

1500
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:14,420
for your council think three things

1501
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:16,970
first of all you should consider this

1502
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:18,789
organization is an extension of your

1503
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:21,950
vision of building the future together

1504
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:25,250
to promote the well-being of Wipeout

1505
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:27,730
it's people we've both got a role to

1506
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:31,130
play in providing solutions to the

1507
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:33,349
high-growth region of the Waikato we

1508
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:36,130
both recognize the need to do more with

1509
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:39,170
less to drive cost out of local councils

1510
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:41,930
we both want to ensure that nationally

1511
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:44,359
the Waikato region punches above its

1512
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:46,940
weight by showing that the region can

1513
01:04:44,359 --> 01:04:49,940
provide them provide joined-up services

1514
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:52,630
across the region and we both want to

1515
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:57,050
improve the well-being of community

1516
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:58,820
indeed it's in your vision secondly as

1517
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:00,349
an organization as I've said before

1518
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:02,180
we're not limited by boundaries we're

1519
01:05:00,349 --> 01:05:05,900
tasked with thinking regionally to

1520
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:07,940
enable you to act better locally and I

1521
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,040
think the opportunities to work with you

1522
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:11,890
and your companion councils to achieve

1523
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:14,630
your aspirations are boundless

1524
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:19,010
regardless and possibly even more but

1525
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:21,140
cause of covert 19 thirdly obviously by

1526
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:23,630
necessity we need resource to achieve

1527
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:25,550
our outcomes and you'll see that some of

1528
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:27,079
the initiatives that we've proposed in a

1529
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:29,270
statement of intent will require some

1530
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:33,530
upfront investment in order to achieve

1531
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:35,359
some mid to long-term savings now I said

1532
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:37,190
I would finish with a few words on

1533
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:38,780
coronavirus it won't surprise you to

1534
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:41,630
know that as a board we've discussed

1535
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:43,369
very early on whether we should make any

1536
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:45,410
substantive changes to our work

1537
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:49,339
programme to reflect what will be a new

1538
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:51,770
reality what we concluded indeed was

1539
01:05:49,339 --> 01:05:52,910
that in fact we should keep doing what

1540
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:56,270
we're doing because it's going to be

1541
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:58,220
even more important moreover it's going

1542
01:05:56,270 --> 01:06:01,430
to help rebuild the region and increase

1543
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:03,800
resilience our view is that in a

1544
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:05,810
postcode of 19 period during the

1545
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,760
recovery period they'll be need in the

1546
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:11,540
region for at least the following three

1547
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:13,069
things first security of Public Works to

1548
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:15,530
enable a private sector to plan

1549
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:17,780
long-range and I think importantly

1550
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:21,310
commit to training and for this staff to

1551
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:23,690
commit to stay in the region secondly a

1552
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:25,490
demonstration of restraint by public

1553
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:27,170
bodies on what might be perceived as

1554
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:30,290
non-essential spending in other words

1555
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:32,240
doing more with less and thirdly

1556
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:33,640
motivation and encouragement and

1557
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:36,279
development

1558
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:38,740
of current council staff now we're

1559
01:06:36,279 --> 01:06:41,200
planning to deliver all of those already

1560
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:44,589
through our work program has set out and

1561
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:46,170
a statement of intent so thank you for

1562
01:06:44,589 --> 01:06:49,480
the opportunity to talk to you I

1563
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:52,299
obviously wish that I could have spoken

1564
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:55,240
with you in person but no doubt that'll

1565
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:57,460
opportunity will arise sometimes shortly

1566
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:59,589
in the future Kelvin and I are more than

1567
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:01,779
happy to take any questions mr. chair

1568
01:06:59,589 --> 01:07:03,940
but I wondered to Kelvin if there is any

1569
01:07:01,779 --> 01:07:10,480
additional points that you want it to

1570
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:14,140
make I welcome and Peter thank you okay

1571
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:18,900
thanks very much for that yeah as you

1572
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:21,460
mentioned less has been active ania ania

1573
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:26,369
between here councils for a number of

1574
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:29,049
years now in being very successful

1575
01:07:26,369 --> 01:07:34,619
particularly with rather the road in

1576
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:38,230
accord but what's happening now is an

1577
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:39,819
absolute steep change and I totally

1578
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:45,640
agree with what you said about it being

1579
01:07:39,819 --> 01:07:49,900
more important post covert rather than

1580
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:54,839
lease so yeah I wish we were success of

1581
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:59,710
course nail questions I think clear yes

1582
01:07:54,839 --> 01:08:00,329
yeah yes thanks Andrew and great to meet

1583
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:03,609
you

1584
01:08:00,329 --> 01:08:05,440
you know and good to see you too Kelvin

1585
01:08:03,609 --> 01:08:09,039
I'm I did seen through some questions

1586
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:12,069
but on to to ones that I just like to

1587
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:15,279
ask them this forum the first one is

1588
01:08:12,069 --> 01:08:18,219
that you know you've made a strong case

1589
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:20,109
for continuing how you're going at the

1590
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:22,000
moment you know that all those things

1591
01:08:20,109 --> 01:08:23,889
that you're focusing on will be more

1592
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,699
important than ever when we are dealing

1593
01:08:23,889 --> 01:08:30,460
in the postcode era I guess um but a lot

1594
01:08:27,699 --> 01:08:33,819
of the things that that are done rely on

1595
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:36,730
the I suppose the goodwill of councils

1596
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:41,350
and releasing resources for from their

1597
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:43,389
business to work on less stuff and I can

1598
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:46,179
foresee that councils are actually going

1599
01:08:43,389 --> 01:08:47,010
to be pretty hard priests with their own

1600
01:08:46,179 --> 01:08:49,260
own

1601
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:50,700
staffing resources dealing with you know

1602
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:53,280
extra things that have come out of the

1603
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:56,160
woodwork to do with covert 19 and so

1604
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:58,590
what assurance can you give us that that

1605
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:00,990
you won't sort of find yourself high and

1606
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:03,030
dry that you can't get that sort of

1607
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:04,110
resource that you do need you know from

1608
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:06,660
the individual councils that have

1609
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:08,880
normally been really supportive because

1610
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:12,170
the idea you started just completely

1611
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,250
committed you know to this other work

1612
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:16,470
okay well would you mind if I answer

1613
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:18,450
that question first and then job

1614
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:20,310
maybe there's a few additional points

1615
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:23,640
you want to make i think counselor thank

1616
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:26,460
you that's a that's a great question the

1617
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:30,330
good news is we had I'm happy to say

1618
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:32,160
thought of that as well and one of the

1619
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:34,320
earliest things that we did well before

1620
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:36,480
lockdown was when we could see this

1621
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:38,780
thing coming was to reach out to

1622
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:41,570
councils to ask them to think about

1623
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:44,010
whether in the context of any

1624
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:45,900
redeployment of assets and people that

1625
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:47,640
they were doing whether there were going

1626
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:50,580
to be some people that might affect be

1627
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:53,490
freed up to be able to work on some of

1628
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:57,180
our projects to make them go faster and

1629
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:58,740
I was pleasantly surprised particularly

1630
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:02,460
from some of the smaller councils to be

1631
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:05,630
honest about the positive response that

1632
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:08,100
we got in terms of offering up staff

1633
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:11,490
that's a first point the second point is

1634
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:13,530
that more specifically Calvin's been in

1635
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:15,480
touch with the chief executives of all

1636
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:18,390
of the councils I think as recently as

1637
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:20,160
yesterday Kelvin where we've set out

1638
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:21,480
some specific skill sets that we're

1639
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,250
looking for in order to be able to

1640
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:27,860
advance some of our strategic projects

1641
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:30,630
so as I say a great question

1642
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:32,400
surprisingly repository sponsz from that

1643
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:35,400
from the councils that we've reached out

1644
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:38,190
to but you're absolutely right then the

1645
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,900
resourcing issue may even flow over time

1646
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:42,900
and it's something we were acutely

1647
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:46,320
conscious of : did you have any point to

1648
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:50,550
it I look I I think that sort of covers

1649
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:54,930
it all off Peter to be honest well it's

1650
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:56,730
really encouraging actually excuse me

1651
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:58,650
could you get that clarification that's

1652
01:10:56,730 --> 01:11:00,030
great the other question I had was about

1653
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:02,219
the energy and

1654
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:05,699
carbon management that's mentioned in

1655
01:11:02,219 --> 01:11:08,460
the SOI yeah I wasn't sure whether there

1656
01:11:05,699 --> 01:11:12,869
is the carbon order that our counselors

1657
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:14,400
sort of before the last election we that

1658
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:15,599
was one of the directions that we gave

1659
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,010
the staff that we wanted to get

1660
01:11:15,599 --> 01:11:19,020
something organizing that which would

1661
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:21,780
help us I suppose

1662
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:24,570
formulate a plan you know for climate

1663
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:28,110
change net and is the energy management

1664
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:33,570
that's mentioned that most unfeeling

1665
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:36,630
into that audit or not so the short

1666
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:38,849
answer is councilor that no it's well

1667
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:41,610
it's certainly not the audit that you

1668
01:11:38,849 --> 01:11:47,130
were referring to I don't see any

1669
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:50,010
particular reason why the people that we

1670
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:53,820
use see that we engage to provide that

1671
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:55,409
support to councils could not help with

1672
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:59,159
that order if there was something that

1673
01:11:55,409 --> 01:12:01,619
that what our executive team we're

1674
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:04,500
interested in doing but I'm not actually

1675
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:05,730
privy to the particular the status of

1676
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:11,250
the particular piece of work that you're

1677
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:13,770
referring to I know that Martin lunch

1678
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:15,449
who's one of the guys tends to work with

1679
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:20,699
why Fire District Council has been doing

1680
01:12:15,449 --> 01:12:22,260
some bespoke work in this area but I'm

1681
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:24,119
not sure whether it specifically relates

1682
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:27,030
to their report that you're referring to

1683
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:32,670
it okay oh thanks thanks for the

1684
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:34,760
clarification it's okay any more

1685
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:38,219
questions

1686
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:40,679
no okay well thank you very much for for

1687
01:12:38,219 --> 01:12:43,730
their presentation and yeah particularly

1688
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:47,309
now in a period of significant change

1689
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:49,050
that's really you know great to see the

1690
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:52,349
positivity we have going forward even

1691
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:54,150
and but with a weird will we have around

1692
01:12:52,349 --> 01:12:56,880
us at the moment so yeah thanks Peter

1693
01:12:54,150 --> 01:13:00,590
Kelvin very much thank you very much mr.

1694
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:04,349
chair he knows yes and I see Andrew

1695
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:07,530
Michael is available and will talk to us

1696
01:13:04,349 --> 01:13:10,530
about the LG FA thank you for the

1697
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:12,909
opportunity and I just maybe make a few

1698
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:14,530
brief comments and then touch on

1699
01:13:12,909 --> 01:13:20,070
current environment and then leave some

1700
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:21,249
time for questions so LGF a started in

1701
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:25,389
2012

1702
01:13:21,249 --> 01:13:27,429
it currently has 67 member councils were

1703
01:13:25,389 --> 01:13:29,949
the number of others and the process of

1704
01:13:27,429 --> 01:13:32,380
joining and the current environment has

1705
01:13:29,949 --> 01:13:34,150
probably just you know even for the

1706
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:36,369
council's that don't have any did they

1707
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:38,530
realize that you know having access to

1708
01:13:36,369 --> 01:13:41,409
finances important sort of probably

1709
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:46,269
speeding up you know be iraq their time

1710
01:13:41,409 --> 01:13:48,610
table for joining an OT fa is based on

1711
01:13:46,269 --> 01:13:51,010
similar models and the scandinavian

1712
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:53,409
countries the longest of those is

1713
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:57,849
endemic that's been going for 130 years

1714
01:13:53,409 --> 01:14:00,669
now so what LG FA wants us to be a very

1715
01:13:57,849 --> 01:14:04,469
long-term provider of financing to the

1716
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:07,809
local authority sector the objectives

1717
01:14:04,469 --> 01:14:09,969
interests savings on councils did to

1718
01:14:07,809 --> 01:14:12,639
provide a range of borrowing options so

1719
01:14:09,969 --> 01:14:15,219
short to him in longer term financing

1720
01:14:12,639 --> 01:14:19,030
and probably the most important one is

1721
01:14:15,219 --> 01:14:20,590
access to deep markets and that's been

1722
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:22,449
the area that specs being the most

1723
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:29,309
challenging and over the past couple of

1724
01:14:22,449 --> 01:14:34,419
months in terms of the financials the

1725
01:14:29,309 --> 01:14:37,150
profit for the year to June 2020 which

1726
01:14:34,419 --> 01:14:40,179
was forecast to be 10 million is on

1727
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:43,869
tricks or even ran the part numbers for

1728
01:14:40,179 --> 01:14:49,059
for April yesterday and again them the

1729
01:14:43,869 --> 01:14:51,010
monthly profit is on track a lot of the

1730
01:14:49,059 --> 01:14:53,619
forecasting that's in the draft II so I

1731
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:55,630
is just out of date it suspense

1732
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:59,409
superseded by the events that we've seen

1733
01:14:55,630 --> 01:15:01,989
the last few months but that said just

1734
01:14:59,409 --> 01:15:04,030
remember that LG FA has ten billion

1735
01:15:01,989 --> 01:15:06,280
dollars of lending to the sector's we

1736
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:08,499
borrowed from investors and on land and

1737
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:11,889
every time we do we take a small margin

1738
01:15:08,499 --> 01:15:15,280
so the profit read on all that lending

1739
01:15:11,889 --> 01:15:18,900
is locked and until those loans mature

1740
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:24,579
so even though there may well be some

1741
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:27,030
variability in profit a lot of others as

1742
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:29,280
lot turn

1743
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:31,260
that's it the profitability probably

1744
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:35,270
shouldn't be your your primary concern

1745
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:38,100
it as we're councils get the savings as

1746
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:41,010
the savings on the interest costs and

1747
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:44,760
certainty around accessing of Finance so

1748
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:48,840
that's probably the key thing the

1749
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:50,970
current environment interest rates low

1750
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:54,180
so maybe that's one little bit of good

1751
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:56,280
news for for councils so short-term

1752
01:15:54,180 --> 01:16:00,050
interest rates counselors like yourself

1753
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:04,950
can borrow below one percent now

1754
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:10,320
longer-term we just completed a 1

1755
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:12,510
billion dollar debt issue just over a

1756
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:15,510
week ago so we borrowed for six years

1757
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:20,250
and we borrowed up 1.4 6% for a billion

1758
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:22,470
dollars so we will add on 20 points to

1759
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:24,180
councils or 25 points to wipe our I

1760
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:27,270
think it is so you'll be accessing

1761
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:29,850
longer to money six year money around

1762
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:33,210
1.7 percent just to give you some idea

1763
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:38,850
of a borrowing costs so that's you know

1764
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:41,790
one bit of good news probably two or

1765
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:44,040
three weeks ago we were receiving recall

1766
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:47,430
borrowing or quiz from councils there's

1767
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:49,470
a lot of councils knowing that maybe you

1768
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:52,950
know fee income is dropping and they

1769
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:54,690
needed to get more money into to cover

1770
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:58,670
that so we've never had a month we have

1771
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:58,670
had a higher amount of borrowing costs

1772
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:05,580
the OGF a was the first count of this

1773
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:07,860
non-government entity

1774
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:12,360
well entity other than the government to

1775
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:16,320
issue in New Zealand since the level

1776
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:18,450
four lockdown was imposed for a while

1777
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:20,520
and Bester's were very reluctant to

1778
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:22,530
invest it's just you know they're

1779
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,230
worried even if we buy we won't be able

1780
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:27,690
to sell things and it's just that whole

1781
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:32,250
risk aversion that we had two

1782
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:35,370
developments one was lgf a haber 1

1783
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:37,800
billion dollar standby facility from the

1784
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:39,900
New Zealand government that expires next

1785
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:44,070
year but the minister

1786
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:46,160
finance provided Alisa to LGF a saying

1787
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:50,580
that the government would roll bed over

1788
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:52,860
the period of time so that support from

1789
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:54,930
the government was just a it's really

1790
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:57,270
symbolic to investors that there's going

1791
01:17:54,930 --> 01:18:00,690
to be there ongoing support from the

1792
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:02,580
government for what LGF a the second

1793
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:04,110
thing that occurred as the Reserve Bank

1794
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:07,080
announced that they were going to buy

1795
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:08,160
back government bonds and subsequent to

1796
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:11,070
that they added

1797
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:13,350
lgf a to the list of securities that

1798
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:15,780
they are able to buy so they signaled

1799
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:19,590
that buy back up to three billion

1800
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:22,350
dollars of LGF a bonds from investors

1801
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:24,360
and it was that that really gave the

1802
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:25,500
confidence to investors that if we buy

1803
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:28,230
them there's actually going to be

1804
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:31,290
another huge buyer in the market for

1805
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:33,720
that so again you know the level of

1806
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:38,810
support that we're getting from the

1807
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:41,700
government has been extremely important

1808
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:46,410
there's going to be significant

1809
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:49,980
challenges for councils particularly in

1810
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:53,640
the 2021 sort of financial year part of

1811
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:56,490
the working group that dia are running

1812
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:59,520
looking at doing a lot of modeling on

1813
01:18:56,490 --> 01:19:01,950
council financial performance this well

1814
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,560
for the remainder of this year and in

1815
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:05,820
next year our next feeding into a lot of

1816
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,920
the other government sort of work

1817
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:10,050
streams such as the recovery sort of a

1818
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:13,980
weak stream so there's some quite

1819
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:17,490
sobering reading coming out of it for

1820
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:20,760
wipeouts you're probably well positioned

1821
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:23,550
in terms of your deep levels not high

1822
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:30,000
relative to some of the other higher

1823
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:31,830
growth councils in New Zealand so yeah

1824
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,720
there are a lot of challenges and that's

1825
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:35,910
probably one of the challenges for us is

1826
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:38,670
that potentially we're going to get

1827
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:41,400
breaches of the financial covenants in

1828
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:43,920
the next financial year not not this

1829
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:46,410
financial year so today we've never had

1830
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:48,990
a breach of the any of the financial

1831
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:52,320
covenants but you know if revenue falls

1832
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:54,570
significantly for councils worth a large

1833
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:56,099
amount of debt to start

1834
01:19:54,570 --> 01:20:00,030
then they could well break that

1835
01:19:56,099 --> 01:20:02,639
neck-deep - to revenue covenant so

1836
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:06,030
that's something we'll have to deal with

1837
01:20:02,639 --> 01:20:08,489
but for those growth councils you know

1838
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:10,679
one of the last tools they've really got

1839
01:20:08,489 --> 01:20:12,659
is you know having to cut their capex

1840
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:15,360
and again next not particularly

1841
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:17,639
conducive to starting growth in the

1842
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,380
economy and is working against a little

1843
01:20:17,639 --> 01:20:25,110
bit of what the government wants to

1844
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:26,849
achieve so I just like to you know we

1845
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:29,639
appreciate that there's no compulsion

1846
01:20:26,849 --> 01:20:31,829
for councils to use LG FA you're still

1847
01:20:29,639 --> 01:20:34,019
free to borrow from any other sources

1848
01:20:31,829 --> 01:20:35,579
that you want so I just like to

1849
01:20:34,019 --> 01:20:38,219
acknowledge that can and the steam

1850
01:20:35,579 --> 01:20:42,409
because wiper was one of the early

1851
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:45,300
supporters of LG FA we very much value

1852
01:20:42,409 --> 01:20:49,039
your support of us and you know the

1853
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:49,039
professional relationship that we have

1854
01:20:49,309 --> 01:20:55,739
thanks Andrew I think yeah almost goes

1855
01:20:54,269 --> 01:20:59,090
without saying but I'll say at anybody

1856
01:20:55,739 --> 01:21:03,480
LG to your face but another great

1857
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:07,199
contributor to the local government seen

1858
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:10,710
generally and certainly well I guess why

1859
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:12,659
power hasn't used your services that

1860
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:16,260
greatly we certainly intend to in the

1861
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:20,929
future possibly even more with Kovac

1862
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:24,150
possibly not we don't know yet do we can

1863
01:21:20,929 --> 01:21:25,800
yeah it's um that's true we we don't

1864
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:27,869
know but um yeah but you're very

1865
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:32,250
comforted by their time but at one point

1866
01:21:27,869 --> 01:21:34,409
Steven position number three yeah there

1867
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:38,639
does and it was very well priced on

1868
01:21:34,409 --> 01:21:41,250
borrowing ability I like the one that

1869
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:44,519
was below 1% even better but he sought

1870
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:46,500
to possibly isn't asked that much know

1871
01:21:44,519 --> 01:21:48,380
where it takes Andrew and does anyone

1872
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:54,150
else have any questions

1873
01:21:48,380 --> 01:22:01,039
Bruce and then clear you're still muted

1874
01:21:54,150 --> 01:22:01,039
Bruce press the spacebar

1875
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:10,970
I don't need to keep creasing it mate

1876
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:14,330
okay I'll change machines one doesn't

1877
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:18,350
work so once in the Bernsen entry just

1878
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:20,840
down page 33 she Kavanagh - white has

1879
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:22,490
got 200 fares and she is at that point

1880
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:24,530
four percent just a simple one

1881
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:27,170
well we're district you've got SS but a

1882
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:34,940
nine point nine never foreseen did you

1883
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:37,280
explain that yes the shareholding is

1884
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:40,610
just something sort of historical so we

1885
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:45,020
know G FA was started at needed 25

1886
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:47,150
million of equity so there was I think

1887
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:50,660
nine or ten councils that were the

1888
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:53,990
initial subscribers and then they won

1889
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:55,720
sold some of the issues to a second

1890
01:22:53,990 --> 01:23:01,910
group of councils that came in these

1891
01:22:55,720 --> 01:23:04,850
shareholders so LG FA pay a small

1892
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:09,590
dividend to councils on their share

1893
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:11,870
holding that as 2% over acosta funds but

1894
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:14,510
our cluster funds might only be like one

1895
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:16,760
and a half percent at the moment so on a

1896
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:18,110
hundred thousand dollars of shares

1897
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:20,270
you're only going to be getting right

1898
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:25,160
the three or four thousand dollar

1899
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:27,050
dividend so that is really not material

1900
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:30,530
so the level of equity you have is

1901
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:33,230
really not that important it is the

1902
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:35,840
savings that you get on your borrowing

1903
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:39,050
costs that are going to be the big you

1904
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,940
know drivers of why you know council

1905
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:43,280
should be means of members of LG obeyed

1906
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:45,980
so it really doesn't give you a lot of

1907
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:48,770
advantage about you know a council bit

1908
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:50,510
as a non shareholder because again the

1909
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:53,270
still getting the same borrowing

1910
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:56,450
benefits that you are it's just simply

1911
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:58,520
effect we needed some councils to put in

1912
01:23:56,450 --> 01:24:00,740
some equity to get the thing off off the

1913
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:04,100
ground so again you know we're grateful

1914
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:06,470
for the council's that did that I think

1915
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:09,110
it interested of doubling a figure in

1916
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:10,430
banking and in ordinary terms of

1917
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,480
thinking well here the head you get

1918
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:13,820
today so no thank you

1919
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:17,510
I just I just whipped it out for you

1920
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:18,200
Bruce it's it's a rounding thing it's

1921
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,970
actually

1922
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:22,370
you got point four four four of a

1923
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:26,390
percent and when you double it you get

1924
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:29,330
point eight eight so it's just rounding

1925
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:31,730
up and down Thank You mr. Chu you're so

1926
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:36,040
knowledgeable all clear

1927
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:39,260
oh yeah thanks Lucretia my head is about

1928
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:41,150
LGA saying one of their principles is

1929
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:43,880
that they'll demonstrate social and

1930
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:45,230
environmental responsibility and one

1931
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:48,200
question that I've been asking and

1932
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:50,120
pastors will LGU they consider

1933
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:52,700
introducing something like green

1934
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:54,560
financing or environmental bonds you

1935
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:58,280
know like the Productivity Commission

1936
01:24:54,560 --> 01:25:00,830
did report to a no emissions economy you

1937
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:03,680
know years ago they highlighted that

1938
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:05,240
actually there's a bit of a gap in New

1939
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:07,370
Zealand with this kind of financing

1940
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:10,040
where councils could borrow for a

1941
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:12,680
project that would be you know reducing

1942
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:15,170
emissions or for environmental outcomes

1943
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:17,270
and usually it's at a slight margin

1944
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:19,460
lease or something and just to say it's

1945
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:22,040
a good thing to be doing and we want to

1946
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:24,380
encourage councils and do you think LG

1947
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:27,320
if they would do that or are you talking

1948
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:29,720
to government about that I thank you for

1949
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:33,440
that question that is the whole

1950
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:35,120
environmental issues have been pushed a

1951
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:38,690
little bit to the back at the moment

1952
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:42,580
because that's going on but ODF a stone

1953
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:45,470
a significant amount of work on it and

1954
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:49,790
we are intending to offer green

1955
01:25:45,470 --> 01:25:53,240
financing to councils so remembering

1956
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:55,070
that it's not LG FA that is doing things

1957
01:25:53,240 --> 01:26:00,590
with the money we just saw and lending

1958
01:25:55,070 --> 01:26:04,520
us resources we've actually got all the

1959
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:06,710
documents up and ready to go but the

1960
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:11,960
issue is we're going to need councils to

1961
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:14,090
identify green projects also there's

1962
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:16,610
three categories of this green social

1963
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:18,710
and sustainable so for example a lot of

1964
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:20,930
the water things actually come under

1965
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:23,660
sustainable so there's a whole industry

1966
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:26,060
around it and a revolt involves

1967
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:29,570
identifying things and also there's a

1968
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:31,369
certification process of Dom net so I

1969
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:34,159
could probably speak if

1970
01:26:31,369 --> 01:26:37,069
a day on this topic because it as if you

1971
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:38,899
see the documents they you know it must

1972
01:26:37,069 --> 01:26:42,199
be like a hundred pages long and we've

1973
01:26:38,899 --> 01:26:44,300
got all that really to go so it is all

1974
01:26:42,199 --> 01:26:45,709
happening but it will be it's not going

1975
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:48,819
to be compulsory it will be up to each

1976
01:26:45,709 --> 01:26:54,729
council is to check how they use that

1977
01:26:48,819 --> 01:26:57,079
but green and beasting is a big theme

1978
01:26:54,729 --> 01:27:00,619
globally probably particularly in Europe

1979
01:26:57,079 --> 01:27:03,260
probably least soem in the US but

1980
01:27:00,619 --> 01:27:06,619
certainly it does give you better access

1981
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:09,379
to to deep markets if you can visit the

1982
01:27:06,619 --> 01:27:10,579
green framework well I'm thrilled to

1983
01:27:09,379 --> 01:27:12,109
hear that you're working on it I

1984
01:27:10,579 --> 01:27:14,300
actually think you should report on it

1985
01:27:12,109 --> 01:27:16,459
say that you're actually preparing or or

1986
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:18,289
you know working on a proposal because I

1987
01:27:16,459 --> 01:27:19,969
think a lot of people would be looking

1988
01:27:18,289 --> 01:27:22,249
for that and yeah disable

1989
01:27:19,969 --> 01:27:25,609
congratulations are I think it's great

1990
01:27:22,249 --> 01:27:27,859
that you made yes some I suppose so

1991
01:27:25,609 --> 01:27:29,389
ground with progress and you look

1992
01:27:27,859 --> 01:27:31,669
forward to seeing you I mean you can

1993
01:27:29,389 --> 01:27:34,699
actually make an announcement

1994
01:27:31,669 --> 01:27:37,010
yeah we don't flip we have a council day

1995
01:27:34,699 --> 01:27:38,689
each year sort of in July and we did

1996
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:40,879
flag that it was something we intend to

1997
01:27:38,689 --> 01:27:43,280

Cheers okay well thanks for that

2009
01:28:18,139 --> 01:28:24,499
everybody we have a recommendation that

2010
01:28:22,519 --> 01:28:29,409
runs from A to G I'm not even going to

2011
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:31,819
attempt to read them all out Kim yeah

2012
01:28:29,409 --> 01:28:33,919
sorry entry probably the thing we just

2013
01:28:31,819 --> 01:28:36,319
need to turn our engine to because

2014
01:28:33,919 --> 01:28:39,319
because obviously a key part of that and

2015
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:41,329
there's series of recommendations as the

2016
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:44,119
three liters that are in them and the

2017
01:28:41,329 --> 01:28:45,380
appendices of open deck some appendix

2018
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:48,440
four five and six

2019
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:50,030
so I do just wonder whether just before

2020
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,430
you and before you pop the

2021
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:55,130
recommendation we've read as just with

2022
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:57,920
I'm just seeking in iam any input into

2023
01:28:55,130 --> 01:29:00,320
those and those three meters because

2024
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,210
obviously when we when we knew to do

2025
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:04,250
proper recommendation you you will be a

2026
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:07,790
century mocking in those weavers

2027
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:10,460
yeah stinks further keen you're very

2028
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:13,160
right I did think of it I read through

2029
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:16,240
them and I felt they've seemed pretty

2030
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:21,350
appropriate as they are because

2031
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:24,380
particularly with Oh custom wine being

2032
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:25,520
there particularly with the airport we

2033
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:28,970
acknowledged that there was going to be

2034
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:30,920
a major revision in theory so I and but

2035
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:36,260
yeah is there anyone does anyone have

2036
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:37,940

2047
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:17,030

01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:18,740
a name again there is a health warning

2049
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:20,570
they're a little bit like I'm like the

2050
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:22,700
for monthly report that you saw at the

2051
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:25,670
last council meeting and obviously

2052
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:30,140
anything an item and the forecast column

2053
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:33,560

2054
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:36,140
events Sonya so I'm a huge effort who's

01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:42,470
weeks to around yet to reef or casting

2058
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:44,720
you should see the results of their pre

2059
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:47,240
forecasting you should have a obviously

2060
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:49,160
a quite a different forecasts column and

2061
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:52,280

74% of the forecast and the operating

2069
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:18,640
expenditure as a 72 percent of the

2070
01:31:14,530 --> 01:31:23,680
four-year forecast we have Vista assets

been no major budget changes this month

2081
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:12,070
due to a forecasting happening now there

2082
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:15,400
was one arbitrage arrangement made on

2083
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:16,600

report and the attachments to this I do

2119
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:49,420
see that there are a couple of questions

2120
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:50,860
from clear but is there any anything

2121
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:52,510
else that you guys would like to ask

2122
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:58,600
before I get to those questions from

2123
01:34:52,510 --> 01:35:02,910
clear looks like the floor is yours

2124
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:06,040
clear he had a couple of questions

2125
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:09,130
yeah well I mean the first one was that

2126
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:12,660
they were for the council entranceways

2127
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:15,640
whether the location of a number of

2128
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:17,530
excellence so if you looked into those

2129
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:21,400
e-tron's ways to see something to do

2130
01:35:17,530 --> 01:35:25,900
with entranceways right yeah beer from

2131
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:26,530
you one two three do they give you what

2132
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:31,090
they were

2133
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:33,810
the tow trips and an entrance ways and

2134
01:35:31,090 --> 01:35:35,830
we did get property to have a look and

2135
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:44,260
there wasn't anything of significance

2136
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:47,560
that we found 93 can you guys hear me

2137
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:49,360
now yeah

2138
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:52,720
yes I we didn't find anything of

2139
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:54,820
significance of why they tripped the

2140
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:59,950
only thing weak it was thought about the

2141
01:35:54,820 --> 01:36:02,110
lip we the doors kind of closed it and

2142
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:04,840
this is it Cambridge so I did property

2143
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:07,440
did have a look at those but we couldn't

2144
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:09,520
find anything that would have caused

2145
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:12,220
those trips and we haven't had any

2146
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:13,690
reported since so it may have been just

2147
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:17,080
one of those things that we are

2148
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:20,260
continuing to monitor anyway yeah yeah I

2149
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:24,820
know that I mean just the our luck that

2150
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:26,950
you know our facilities are the causing

2151
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:29,140
causing a problem for people that are

2152
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:30,790
coming into this year yeah so I just

2153
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:36,520
thought be good to know a bit more about

2154
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:40,360
it yeah okay no can you hear me yes

2155
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:43,390
wonderful I'm so sorry I lost my voice

2156
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:45,130
beer for a minute so I clear I

2157
01:36:43,390 --> 01:36:48,100
understood you had another question as

2158
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:50,170
well and that was regarding what ways we

2159
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:51,910
have to keep track of how how the safety

2160
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:54,130
resources and processes are being

2161
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:57,520
utilized yeah there's a really good

2162
01:36:54,130 --> 01:37:01,200
question perhaps if I if you go to the

2163
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:03,550
the a3 or the big report on the page

2164
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:06,850
above the health and safety due

2165
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:08,740
diligence plan monitoring above that is

2166
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:12,220
the health and safety lead indicators

2167
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:15,130
now these lead indicators are basically

2168
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:18,550
the resources and the contractors that

2169
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:21,580
we use and so essentially what we pay

2170
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:24,460
for and that's how we monitor and

2171
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:25,690
provide to you the details and what

2172
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:28,390
we're spending our health and safety

2173
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:31,900
budget on we do have a very small health

2174
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:33,610
and safety budget obviously but what

2175
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:36,990
does health and safety lead indicators

2176
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:39,880
shows you is that we we pay an ongoing

2177
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:42,010
fee to the work head of Occupational

2178
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:45,120
Consultancy who deliver our health

2179
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:49,510
monitoring services we also provide

2180
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:50,650
money to the EAP service which is so

2181
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:52,540
provides

2182
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:56,230
I guess counseling services to all of

2183
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:58,330
our staff we also have training health

2184
01:37:56,230 --> 01:38:00,880
and safety training so we have set aside

2185
01:37:58,330 --> 01:38:03,730
twenty one thousand for health and

2186
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:06,310
safety training and an annual year and

2187
01:38:03,730 --> 01:38:09,219
that's that obviously is first aid

2188
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:12,850
refreshers and our health and safety

2189
01:38:09,219 --> 01:38:14,530
committee training as well as any

2190
01:38:12,850 --> 01:38:17,199
investigation training which we are

2191
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:19,659
looking at at the moment and our regular

2192
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:21,100
conflict training which is obviously

2193
01:38:19,659 --> 01:38:23,380
comes out of that budget as well and

2194
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:25,900
these are all reported through these

2195
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:29,110
reporting mechanisms to yourselves and

2196
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:31,300
also to be executive team so I guess

2197
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:34,780
that's one of our due diligence and how

2198
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:37,620
we show that we are utilizing external

2199
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:40,510
resources and finances appropriately I

2200
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:42,699
know that that's a great explanation and

2201
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:46,000
I can see how it all fits together I

2202
01:38:42,699 --> 01:38:48,909
guess I was wondering about how you knew

2203
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,440
if just individual staff members were

2204
01:38:48,909 --> 01:38:55,090
actually you know knowledgeable about

2205
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:57,130
health and safety practices or if they

2206
01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:59,710
were studying new tasks or something

2207
01:38:57,130 --> 01:39:02,760
that they did actually get the right

2208
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:06,070
briefing and stuff like they're like a

2209
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:09,639
confident that that kind of sort of more

2210
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:13,120
grassroots those processes are working

2211
01:39:09,639 --> 01:39:14,980
well as well I think being feel free to

2212
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:18,630
jump in here but I'm actually very

2213
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:21,929
confident because we have some very good

2214
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:25,210
well-educated Health and Safety

2215
01:39:21,929 --> 01:39:28,929
representatives now and I must say they

2216
01:39:25,210 --> 01:39:31,420
are commits they attend the meetings

2217
01:39:28,929 --> 01:39:34,050
they go back to their respective teams

2218
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:36,250
and they disseminate that information

2219
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:40,080
you know we're making sure that any

2220
01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:43,150
training his doubts fear I've got bf and

2221
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:45,780
Terry now working with all staff and

2222
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:50,400
specially team leaders and supervisors

2223
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:50,400
about how to keep your staff safe

2224
01:39:52,730 --> 01:39:56,640
today yes thank you can you hear me all

2225
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:59,310
right

2226
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:02,550
I can no doesn't seem to be coming

2227
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:07,050
through my headphones I think this is a

2228
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:11,760
great report but the question I have is

2229
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:14,730
is there any way that we can assess some

2230
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:21,090
of the external influences on our team's

2231
01:40:14,730 --> 01:40:23,070
health and safety from Corbett 19 yes

2232
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:26,219
absolutely and again be feel free to

2233
01:40:23,070 --> 01:40:29,480
jump in here this report only covers the

2234
01:40:26,219 --> 01:40:32,730
period from November through February so

2235
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:35,219
critically it misses essentially misses

2236
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:39,420
all the covert 19 that will come in the

2237
01:40:35,219 --> 01:40:42,870
next report but yes absolutely we are we

2238
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:44,730
have a staff monitor will start register

2239
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:47,400
which we monitor the health and

2240
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:54,420
well-being of all our staff any that

2241
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:56,670
have immuno compromised health issues we

2242
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:59,910
are aware of where our staff what

2243
01:40:56,670 --> 01:41:03,690
they're doing and with our slightly

2244
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:05,969
moving to level three next week we've

2245
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:08,250
gone out to all managers to advise us of

2246
01:41:05,969 --> 01:41:09,870
where exactly their staff are going to

2247
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:12,210
be working whether they will be

2248
01:41:09,870 --> 01:41:15,120
continuing to work from home whether we

2249
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:18,030
will have some like our parks operators

2250
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:20,580
working back out in the community and

2251
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:22,140
from a health and safety perspective we

2252
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:24,000
are working up some really good

2253
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:27,480
protocols around how to keep them more

2254
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,940
safe so I hope hope that's answered your

2255
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:33,960
your question counselor Gordon yeah I

2256
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:35,880
was more wondering about whether any of

2257
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:37,679
the external influences over which we've

2258
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:39,719
got no control you know that they're

2259
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:41,520
actually finding in their own family

2260
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:44,850
circumstances on something like that

2261
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:47,730
that's actually affecting their their

2262
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:51,120
mental state which obviously is a health

2263
01:41:47,730 --> 01:41:54,150
and safety issue I can come in here if

2264
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:59,070
you like Steve I'm from I've just coming

2265
01:41:54,150 --> 01:42:00,690
out of a webinar with EMA and which one

2266
01:41:59,070 --> 01:42:02,460
of New Zealand's leading people and

2267
01:42:00,690 --> 01:42:05,909
health or safety Paul javi was part of

2268
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:08,670
so that she rolled out quite a few

2269
01:42:05,909 --> 01:42:13,080
ways on how this can be managed and

2270
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:15,150
multiple levels and I know that our

2271
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:17,880
wiper team have been working along those

2272
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:19,739
same lines so you know this is all

2273
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:23,000
pretty new to everybody so we're still

2274
01:42:19,739 --> 01:42:25,230
writing up those protocols and and

2275
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,380
hopefully getting everything in place

2276
01:42:25,230 --> 01:42:31,980
prior to actually going out next week on

2277
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:39,420
